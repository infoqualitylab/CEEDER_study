127489,"Impacts of climate change on tropical agroforestry systems: A systematic review for identifying future research priorities","Watts, M; Hutton, C; Guel, EOM; Suckall, N; Peh, KSH",2022,"Climate change is expected to adversely affect the crop yields and food security for many smallholder farmers in the tropics unless adaptive measures are implemented. Agroforestry ecosystem services, such as micro-climate buffering, have received growing attention from the academic and policy communities for alleviating the negative impacts of climate change on smallholders. These benefits imply that agroforestry could offer a suitable measure for adaptation to climate change. However, whether agroforestry systems themselves succumb to the adverse effects of climate change is often less studied in the agroforestry literature. Consequently, less is known about how climate change will impact agroforests. We conducted a systematic review, which included an evidence quality assessment, to examine the impacts of climate change on tropical agroforestry systems (TAFS). Based primarily on studies undertaking biophysical approaches, we found that climate change negatively impacts TAFS by reducing tree growth, intensifying tree-crop resource competition and reducing crop yields. However, the impacts on smallholder farmers are less clear due to limited evidence in the relevant literature. We found that the evidence supporting our findings is mostly 'robust ', although 'least robust ' strength evidence was also commonly found. We conclude that to improve understanding of how climate change could affect the performance of TAFS as a social ecological system, more interdisciplinary studies are required. Furthermore, to improve the quality of evidence in the research field, studies should explore using mountain elevation gradients for climate analog analysis to perform the most robust study designs. We provide an interdisciplinary conceptual model, which considers the interactions and feedbacks between TAFS components noted from our review to predict the response of ecosystem services provisioning and farmers' wellbeing to climate change, to guide interdisciplinary studies using climate analog analysis.","FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2022.880621' target='_blank'>10.3389/ffgc.2022.880621</a>",,"What are the impacts of climate change on trees, soil, crops and livelihoods in tropical agroforestry ecosystems?",2,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3,"Evidence Review"
127478,"Responses of soil greenhouse gas emissions to land use conversion and reversion-A global meta-analysis","Feng, ZH; Wang, LQ; Wan, XM; Yang, J; Peng, Q; Liang, T; Wang, YZ; Zhong, BQ; Rinklebe, J",2022,"Exploring the responses of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to land use conversion or reversion is significant for taking effective land use measures to alleviate global warming. A global meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the responses of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to land use conversion or reversion, and determine their temporal evolution, driving factors, and potential mechanisms. Our results showed that CH4 and N2O responded positively to land use conversion while CO2 responded negatively to the changes from natural herb and secondary forest to plantation. By comparison, CH4 responded negatively to land use reversion and N2O also showed negative response to the reversion from agricultural land to forest. The conversion of land use weakened the function of natural forest and grassland as CH4 sink and the artificial nitrogen (N) addition for plantation increased N source for N2O release from soil, while the reversion of land use could alleviate them to some degree. Besides, soil carbon would impact CO2 emission for a long time after land use conversion, and secondary forest reached the CH4 uptake level similar to that of primary forest after over 40 years. N2O responses had negative relationships with time interval under the conversions from forest to plantation, secondary forest, and pasture. In addition, meta-regression indicated that CH4 had correlations with several environmental variables, and carbon-nitrogen ratio had contrary relationships with N2O emission responses to land use conversion and reversion. And the importance of driving factors displayed that CO2, CH4, and N2O response to land use conversion and reversion was easily affected by NH4+ and soil moisture, mean annual temperature and NO3-, total nitrogen and mean annual temperature, respectively. This study would provide enlightenments for scientific land management and reduction of GHG emissions.","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16370' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.16370</a>",,"What are the effects of land use conversion on soil greenhouse gas flux?",3,1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"

A meta-analysis identified strategies to decrease product-based (PB; CH4 per unit meat or milk) and absolute (ABS) enteric CH4 emissions while maintaining or increasing animal productivity (AP; weight gain or milk yield). Next, the potential of different adoption rates of one PB or one ABS strategy to contribute to the 1.5 degrees C target was estimated. The database included findings from 430 peer-reviewed studies, which reported 98 mitigation strategies that can be classified into three categories: animal and feed management, diet formulation, and rumen manipulation. A random-effects meta-analysis weighted by inverse variance was carried out. Three PB strategies-namely, increasing feeding level, decreasing grass maturity, and decreasing dietary forage-to-concentrate ratio-decreased CH4 per unit meat or milk by on average 12% and increased AP by a median of 17%. Five ABS strategies-namely CH4 inhibitors, tanniferous forages, electron sinks, oils and fats, and oilseeds-decreased daily methane by on average 21%. Globally, only 100% adoption of the most effective PB and ABS strategies can meet the 1.5 degrees C target by 2030 but not 2050, because mitigation effects are offset by projected increases in CH 4 due to increasing milk and meat demand. Notably, by 2030 and 2050, low- and middle-income countries may not meet their contribution to the 1.5 degrees C target for this same reason, whereas high-income countries could meet their contributions due to only a minor projected increase in enteric CH4 emissions.","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2111294119' target='_blank'>10.1073/pnas.2111294119</a>",,"What are the relative effects of different management strategies on methane emissions from global ruminant agriculture systems?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"
127480,"The response of ecosystem carbon and nitrogen pools to experimental warming in grasslands: a meta-analysis","Zou, JL; Wu, JY; Osborne, B; Luo, YQ",2022,"Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) coupling processes in terrestrial ecosystems have the potential to modify the sensitivity of the global C cycle to climate change. But the degree to which C-N interactions contribute to the sequestration of terrestrial ecosystem C (C-seq), both now and in the future, remains uncertain. In this study, we used a meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize C and N responses from field experiments on grasslands subjected to simulated warming and assessed the relative importance of three properties (changes in ecosystem N amount, redistribution of N among soil, litter and vegetation, and modifications in the C:N ratio) associated with grassland C-seq in response to warming. Warming increased soil, litter and vegetation C:N ratios and approximately 2% of N shifted from the soil to vegetation and litter. Warming-induced grassland C-seq was the result of the net balance between increases in vegetation and litter C (111.2 g m(-2)) and decreases in soil C (30.0 g m(-2)). Warming-induced accumulation of C stocks in grassland ecosystems indicated that the three processes examined were the main contributors to C-seq, with the changes in C:N ratios in soil, litter and vegetation as the major contributors, followed by N redistribution, whilst a decrease in total N had a negative effect on C-seq. These results indicate that elevated temperatures have a significant influence on grassland C and N stocks and their coupling processes, suggesting that ecological models need to include C-N interactions for more accurate predictions of future terrestrial C storage.","JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rtac020' target='_blank'>10.1093/jpe/rtac020</a>",,"What are the impacts of experimental warming on carbon and nitrogen stocks in grasslands?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"
127445,"The response of soil-atmosphere greenhouse gas exchange to changing plant litter inputs in terrestrial forest ecosystems","Cui, J.; Lam, S.K.; Xu, S.; Lai, D.Y.F.",2022,"Various global change factors (e.g. elevated CO2 concentrations, nitrogen deposition, etc.) can alter the amount of litterfall in terrestrial forests, which could subsequently lead to changes in the physical, chemical, and biological properties of forest soils. Yet, there is hitherto a lack of consensus on the role of litter in governing the soil-atmosphere exchange of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in forest ecosystems, which can significantly affect the overall climatic cooling impacts of forests as a net carbon sink. In this study, we carried out a meta-analysis of over 250 field observations to determine the response of soil GHG fluxes to in situ litter manipulation in global forests. Our results showed that overall, litter addition enhanced soil CO2 emissions from terrestrial forests by 26%, while litter removal reduced soil CO2 emissions from these forests by 26%. The negative response of soil CO2 emissions to litter removal was stronger in the tropical forests (−33%) than in the subtropical (−27%) and temperate (−21%) forests, and was significantly correlated with mean annual temperature and precipitation. Moreover, litter removal was observed to enhance soil CH4 uptake in tropical (+24%) and temperate (+9%) forests, but not in subtropical forests. Litter removal reduced N2O emissions from forest soils by 20% on average, with this negative effect increasing with mean annual precipitation. The duration of litter removal experiment was negatively correlated with the response of soil CO2 emissions but had no influence on the response of soil CH4 and N2O fluxes. We found that plant litter supply could alter soil GHG fluxes in forests by modulating the microclimate as well as the labile and recalcitrant soil carbon pools. Our findings highlighted the importance of considering the effects of changing plant litter inputs on soil-atmosphere GHG fluxes in terrestrial forests and their spatio-temporal variability in biogeochemical models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Science of the Total Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155995' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155995</a>",,"What is the effect of litter manipulation on the flux of greenhouse gases in forest soils?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"
127450,"Impacts of crop type, management and soil quality indicators on background nitrous oxide emissions (BNE) from Chinese croplands: a quantitative review and analysis","Abdalla, M; Shang, ZY; Espenberg, M; Cui, XQ; Mander, U; Smith, P",2022,"N2O emissions (BNE) represents emissions from unfertilised soils during the current growing season or year and these contribute to total N2O emissions. In this quantitative review and analysis, we collected 146 papers reporting BNE from 378 arable crop sites across China. The main aims were to estimate the BNE from Chinese cropland soils and to assess impacts of crop type, management and soil quality indicators on BNE. Data on sites, crops, management and soil quality indicators were collected. The data were segregated into cereal crops, rice and vegetables, and yield- and area-scaled BNE were calculated. The daily and annual BNE values (mean +/- standard deviation) for cereals, rice and vegetables are 1.32 +/- 1.16, 3.64 +/- 3.84 and 10.68 +/- 16.22 g N2O-N ha(-1) and 0.98 +/- 0.83, 1.11 +/- 0.49 and 2.86 +/- 2.33 kg N-N2O ha(-1), respectively. Crop types have significant impacts (p < 0.05) on the BNE values from soils. The overall mean annual BNE for China, considering the proportion of planting area for each crop type, is 0.69 +/- 1.52 kg N-N2O ha(-1). The total national mean annual BNE for China is 146 +/- 109 Gg N2O-N. The BNE from different crop types is variably controlled by interactions of many factors but primarily by soil quality indicators (i.e. pH, soil N, soil C), climate and management. To reduce uncertainty in the total N2O emissions from Chinese croplands, we suggest estimating the BNE at a national level, rather than using the default value of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of 1 kg N2O-N ha(-1).","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-ATMOSPHERES","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ea00033d' target='_blank'>10.1039/d2ea00033d</a>","N2O EMISSIONS; FERTILIZER; SYSTEMS; NITRATE; MINERALIZATION; TEMPERATURE; MOISTURE; CLIMATE; CARBON; GASES","What is the impact of crop type, management and soil quality indicators on background nitrous oxide emissions in Chinese croplands?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,3,"Evidence Review"

However, few studies have conducted a quantitative analysis of the effects of these management practices. Here, we selected 156 observations of water management from 34 articles and 288 observations of fertilizer management from 37 articles and conducted a global meta-analysis of the effects of water and fertilizer management practices on soil CH4 emissions in paddy fields. In general, compared with traditional irrigation (long-term flooding irrigation), water-saving irrigation significantly decreased soil CH4 emissions but increased rice yield. Among the different practices, intermittent irrigation had the fewest reductions in CH4 emissions but the greatest increase in rice yield. In addition, fertilization management practices such as manure, mixed fertilizer (mixture), and straw significantly enhanced CH4 emissions. Rice yields were increased under fertilization with a mixture, traditional fertilizer, and controlled release fertilizer. Our results highlight that suitable agricultural water and fertilizer management practices are needed to effectively reduce CH4 emissions while maintaining rice yields. We also put forward some prospects for mitigating soil CH4 emissions from paddy fields in the context of global warming in the future.","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127324' target='_blank'>10.3390/ijerph19127324</a>",,"What is the effect of water or fertilizer management practices, compared to no fertilizer or traditional irrigation, on methane emissions from Rice Paddy Fields?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"

Fluctuations caused by climate change would inevitably affect the ecosystems' structure and functions. However, the linkage between cold biome ecosystems and global changes demonstrates high spatial heterogeneity, especially between high-latitude ecosystems (HL) and high-altitude alpine ecosystems (HA). A comparative analysis of their response patterns would provide deeper insight into the underlying mechanisms at play. We used meta-analysis to synthesize ecosystems' response to warming and altered precipitation performed in HL and HA. Warming and enhanced precipitation increases ecosystem biomass and carbon fluxes in HL and HA. Warming significantly stimulates aboveground biomass (AGB), root biomass (RB), total biomass (TB), aboveground net primary productivity, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), soil respiration (SR), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in HL and HA. Similarly, AGB, GEP, and NEP increase significantly with enhanced precipitation. Respondent of ecosystem carbon storage and fluxes in HL and HA showed diverse results to warming treatment. Warming increases AGB and RB in HA while RB remains unaltered in HL. GEP and ER exhibit a positive response to warming in HL but an insignificant response in HA. In general, HL is sensitive to warming, and HA is sensitive to precipitation. The differential responses of HL and HA to climate change imply specific ecosystem traits and particular environmental constraining factors.

However, the mechanisms underlying N2O fluxes are poorly understood. The effects of grazing activity on grassland N2O emission rates, soil and plant characteristics were investigated using a meta-analysis approach. This study revealed that the effect size of grazing was 0.31 +/- 0.08 on N2O emission rates (p < 0.0001), and N2O fluxes increased by 36.27% than control. Light, moderate, and high grazing increased N2O emission rates by 34.62, 19.48, and 62.16%, respectively. The effect size of moderate grazing was significantly lower than that of high grazing (p < 0.05). The effect size of grazing on pH was significant (p < 0.05), and pH increased by 6.51% compared with control. Both soil ammonia and nitrate levels increased by 12.24 and 8.60%, respectively. However, grazing decreased soil total carbon, total phosphorus, and available phosphorus by 14.4, 10.25, and 10.15%, respectively. Grazing significantly decreased plant diversity (p < 0.05), richness, and aboveground biomass by 15.16, 23.7, and 30.7% (p < 0.01), respectively (p < 0.01). Aboveground biomass significantly influenced effect size on N2O emissions, explaining 13.36% of the variations. The direct coefficient of aboveground biomass on effect sizes was -0.631 based on the structural equation model.

However, a systematic investigation of the impact of non-native plant invasion on GHG dynamics at a global scale has not yet been conducted, making it impossible to predict the exact biological feedback of non-native plant invasion to global climate change. Here, we compiled 273 paired observational cases from 94 peer-reviewed articles to evaluate the effects of plant invasion on GHG emissions and to identify the associated key drivers. Non-native plant invasion significantly increased methane (CH4) emissions from 129 kg CH4 ha(-1) year(-1) in natural wetlands to 217 kg CH4 ha(-1) year(-1) in invaded wetlands. Plant invasion showed a significant tendency to increase CH4 uptakes from 2.95 to 3.64 kg CH4 ha(-1) year(-1) in terrestrial ecosystems. Invasive plant species also significantly increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in grasslands from an average of 0.76 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1) in native sites to 1.35 kg N2O ha(-1) year(-1) but did not affect N2O emissions in forests or wetlands. Soil organic carbon, mean annual air temperature (MAT), and nitrogenous deposition (N_DEP) were the key factors responsible for the changes in wetland CH4 emissions due to plant invasion. The responses of terrestrial CH4 uptake rates to plant invasion were mainly driven by MAT, soil NH4+, and soil moisture. Soil NO3-, mean annual precipitation, and N_DEP affected terrestrial N2O emissions in response to plant invasion.

Here, we addressed these knowledge gaps by combining meta-analysis and the random forest (RF) model, based on data compiled from 101 studies. The quantitative effects of anthropogenic, edaphic, and climatic factors and their interactions on SIC content were first examined using the meta-analysis method, and then the relative importance of each examined factor was further determined using the RF model. The results demonstrated that SIC content significantly increased by 6.55% and 9.25% for cultivation and land use change, respectively, compared with that of the control, regardless of any influencing factors. Moreover, the grand mean changes in SIC content due to anthropogenic activities were found to be greatly affected by varied climatic, edaphic, and practical factors.

The effects of N on plants can be altered by complex environmental changes. However, conflicting results have been reported on the co-effects of N and climatic variables on plant performance, which may be attributed to differences in experiment setting and approach, e.g., ecosystem, duration, plant type, and fertilizer form. To elucidate the general response of plant performance to increasing soil N availability under climate change, a global meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize 380 publications studying interactions of N enrichment and four climatic variables (e.g., elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO2), drought, precipitation, and warming) on performance-related traits (e.g., size, nutrient, and fitness). Results showed that N enrichment increased shoot and root size, nutrient, and fitness of terrestrial plants. The synergistic interactions of N × eCO2 and antagonistic interactions of N × drought were found on plant overall performance (mainly on plant size), indicating that the N effects can be aggregated by eCO2 and mitigated by drought. The co-effects of N and climatic variables on plant overall performance rely on experiment approach, duration, ecosystem type, or plant functional type. Synergistic interactions of N × eCO2 and antagonistic interactions of N × drought, N × precipitation, and N × warming on plant overall performance were found mainly in greenhouse experiments and short-term experiments (duration ≤ one year), but not in the field or longer-term experiments. The results highlighted that N effects on plant performance were not isolated, but can be modified by climate changes.

Soil mulching either with plastic film or straw is a common agricultural practice, which can improve crop growth by reducing evaporation and regulating soil temperature, and is widely applied globally. Although soil mulching can significantly affect crop yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there is controversy regarding its effect on crop yield and GHG emissions in the long run. We conducted a meta-analysis to explore the impact of soil mulching practices on maize, wheat, and rice yield and GHG emissions in China. Our results demonstrated that soil mulching improved crop yield (16 – 22%), and its impact on GHG emissions varied with crop, region, and mulching method.

Numerous studies have examined SOC and TN dynamics in different cropping systems. However, there is some uncertainty regarding the relative impacts of some CA practices, and it is not always clear how other agricultural management, particularly nitrogen addition, interacts with these practices to influence SOC and TN sequestration. Thus, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 752 comparisons from 97 papers to analyze the impacts of nitrogen fertilizers and CA practices (namely crop diversification, minimal soil disturbance (no-tillage) and permanent soil cover), on SOC and TN content worldwide. Overall, our study showed the most significant increase of SOC [21.39 % (CI = 15.16 to 28.64)] and TN [54.34 % (CI = 26.19 to 96.69)] stock with CA practices compared to conventional practices in the 0–15 cm soil depth. It also showed a significant increase in SOC and TN stock with all the individual components of CA compared to conventional practices in the 0–15 cm soil depth. However, the impact of CA on SOC and TN is reduced in 0–60 cm depths compared to surface soil depths due to the limited input of crop residue deeper in the soil profile. Manure and manure mixed with mineral-N led to greater SOC sequestration [20.67 % (CI = 15.23 to 27.10) and 41.67 % (CI = 31.03 to 52.79), respectively] than mineral-N alone [9.08 % (CI = 6.44 to 11.83)]. Cropping systems that included legume residue decreased the C/N ratio. This highlights that adequate mineral-N fertilizer addition may also be required in conjunction with residue retention practices to improve SOC and TN content. Overall, these results show that CA systems that include legume residue and manure mixed with mineral-N have great potential to increase SOC and TN, particularly at 0–15 cm and 0–30 cm soil depth. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Science of the Total Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156822' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156822</a>",,"What is the impact of conservation agriculture on organic carbon and total nitrogen in soils?",3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"

This study analyzed these previously published data to compare N2O emissions in oil palm plantations to reference forests. A linear mixed-effects model was used to examine the significance of the effect of establishing oil palm plantations on N2O emissions, rather than to calculate mean effect sizes because of limitations in the data structure. The results indicated that N2O emissions were significantly greater from oil palm plantations than from reference forests, as expected.

In this study, by using a global meta-analysis of 64 observations from 29 peer-reviewed publications over the last 30 years, we elucidated how forest harvest impacted soil N2O flux and related soil properties. Intensive forest harvest significantly increased soil N2O flux with a mean effect size of 0.85 and the increase was associated with elevated soil temperature, increased concentration of NO3--N and decreased soil pH. The effect on soil N2O flux lasted for around six years, and soil N2O emission depended on existing forest types in the late stage (the recovery period > 6 years) after harvest. Forest harvest clearly increased soil N2O flux, with effect size ranging 0.73-2.12, in broadleaf forests but did not significantly affect it in coniferous and mixed broadleaf conifer forests. In addition, the time required for the complete recovery from harvest in terms of N2O flux was difficult to define because of the scarcity of long-term experiments. Overall, this study provides the first formal global-scale assessment on how forest harvest intensity, forest types and the time since harvest affect soil N2O flux. The findings of this study help to narrow the knowledge gap regarding the effect of forest harvest on soil N2O flux, and to facilitate decision making to decrease soil N2O emission post forest harvest.","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108712' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108712</a>",,"What is the effect of forest harvest on nitrous oxide emission of soils?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

However, there has been no comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the response of SOC content to CR and its underlying drivers on the global level. Using 513 pairwise data from 167 studies, we conducted a global-scale meta-analysis to illuminate the changes in SOC content induced by CR and to explore the roles of climatic, edaphic, and agronomic factors in driving such changes. Results revealed that CR overall enhanced SOC content by 6.6% relative to continuous crop monoculture. SOC content under CR increased more in regions with intermediate mean annual temperature (MAT, 8-15C) and precipitation (MAP, 600-1000 mm) than in regions with other climate types. CR had greater SOC content benefits in neutral (pH = 6-8) soils with loamy texture and medium levels of initial SOC (15-20 g kg(-1)) and total nitrogen (1.00-1.50 g kg(-1)). Also, CR performed better in the soybean-based cropping systems with more rotation cycles, longer rotation length, medium nitrogen fertilization input rate (100-200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), and the applications of no-till, straw retention, and organic fertilizers. Furthermore, the variance partitioning analysis revealed that soil (31%) and climate variables (18%) accounted for the major variations in SOC content response. Moreover, the random forest model demonstrated that soil texture, climatic factors (i.e., MAT and MAP), and initial SOC content were the predominant drivers of the response of SOC content. Overall, our findings highlight that CR is a critical practice to increase SOC content in global croplands, whereas the variations in response are governed by specific climatic, edaphic, and agronomic factors. This study helps to establish and manage site-specific CR systems that could enhance SOC in agroecosystems, ultimately facilitating carbon neutrality.","AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108017' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.agee.2022.108017</a>",,"What is the effect of crop rotation on soil organic carbon content?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Human activities have vastly increased nitrogen (N) deposition rate in China, which in turn influences belowground C cycle processes. We performed a meta-analysis based on 61 published studies on N addition experiments, including 4072 observations across China, to quantify the responses of belowground soil C dynamics and sequestration to N enrichment in Chinese forest ecosystems. The results showed that, on average, N enrichment significantly enhanced C dynamics in boreal and temperate forests by an average of 24% and 10% while it reduced in subtropical and tropical forests by 11% and 19%. The response of C pools and C input to N addition were more pronounced in boreal forests with +17% and +10% while it was lower in subtropical forests with-0.4% and-19% respectively. The N enrichment enhanced soil C output by in boreal (6%) and temperate (7%) forests and a negative effect in subtropical (-30%) and tropical forests (-10%). This can be explained by the higher reduction levels in C respiration, despite the slightly lower litter and root-derived C inputs. Notably, N addition specifically increased belowground C sequestration, at low N addition rates (< 30 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and during a short-term period (< 1 year). These C sequestration effects were reversed at higher N deposition levels and /or during a longer time period.

Meanwhile, global temperature has been rising with the increase of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Although soil mulching (SM) is an effective method to increase crop yield because it could conserve soil moisture and temperature, it is also an important factor affecting GHG productions and emissions. At present, research results in terms of the impact of SM on agricultural GHG emissions are still inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analysis was used to quantitatively analyze the impact of SM on crop yield and GHG emissions in China. Overall, SM significantly enhanced not only crop yield, but also GHG emissions. Compared with no soil mulching (NSM), SM improved crop yield by 21.84%, while increased global warming potential (GWP) by 11.38%. To minimize the negative impact of SM on GHG, for maize and wheat in arid, semi-arid and semi-humid zones, it is recommended to use flat full mulching with grave or straw plus drip irrigation under neutral or weakly alkaline soil with bulk density &lt; 1.3g cm-3.

The objective of this meta-analysis was to review the effects of tree attributes and local climatic conditions on the time since death of coarse woody debris ranging in decomposition states. Results from our meta-analysis showed that projected warming will likely accelerate wood decomposition and significantly decrease the residence time in decay stages. By promoting such a decrease in residence time, further climate warming is very likely to alter the dynamics of deadwood, which in turn may affect saproxylic biodiversity by decreasing the temporal availability of specific habitats. Moreover, while coarse woody debris has been recognized as a key resource for bioenergy at the global scale, the acceleration of decay-stages transition dynamics indicates that the temporal window during which dead trees are available as feedstock for value-added products will shrink. Consequently, future planning and implementation of salvage harvesting will need to occur within a short period following disturbance, especially in warmer regions dominated by hardwood species. Another important contribution of this work was the development of a harmonized classification system that relies on the correspondence between the visual criteria used to characterize deadwood decomposition stages in locally developed systems the literature. This system could be used in future investigations to facilitate direct comparisons between studies. Our literature survey also highlights that most of the information on wood decay dynamics comes from temperate and boreal forests, whereas data from subtropical, equatorial and subarctic forests are scarce.

A review","Pulido-Moncada, M.; Petersen, S.O.; Munkholm, L.J.",2022,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the contributor to agricultural greenhouse gas emissions with the highest warming global potential. It is widely recognised that traffic and animal-induced compaction can lead to an increased potential for N2O emissions by decreasing soil oxygen supply. The extent to which the spatial and temporal variability of N2O emissions can be explained by soil compaction is unclear. This review aims to comprehensively discuss soil compaction effects on N2O emissions, and to understand how compaction may promote N2O emission hotspots and hot moments. An impact factor of N2O emissions due to compaction was calculated for each selected study; compaction effects were evaluated separately for croplands, grasslands and forest lands. Topsoil compaction was found to increase N2O emissions by 1.3 to 42 times across sites and land uses. Large impact factors were especially reported for cropland and grassland soils when topsoil compaction—induced by field traffic and/or grazing—is combined with nitrogen input from fertiliser or urine. Little is known about the contribution of subsoil compaction to N2O emissions. Water-filled pore space is the most common water metric used to explain N2O emission variability, but gas diffusivity is a parameter with higher prediction potential. Microbial community composition may be less critical than the soil environment for N2O emissions, and there is a need for comprehensive studies on association between environmental drivers and soil compaction. Lack of knowledge about the interacting factors causing N2O accumulation in compacted soils, at different degrees of compactness and across different spatial scales, limits the identification of high-risk areas and development of efficient mitigation strategies. Soil compaction mitigation strategies that aim to loosen the soil and recover pore system functionality, in combination with other agricultural management practices to regulate N2O emission, should be evaluated for their effectiveness across different agro-climatic conditions and scales. © 2022, The Author(s).","Agronomy for Sustainable Development","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-022-00773-9' target='_blank'>10.1007/s13593-022-00773-9</a>","Gas diffusivity; Hot moments; Hotspots; Subsoil compaction; Topsoil compaction; agricultural ecosystem; itrous oxide; pore space; soil emission; soil microorganism; subsoil; topsoil","What is the impact of soil compaction on nitrous oxide emissions?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,"Evidence Review"

A growing number of field studies have investigated the effect of warming on GHG fluxes, but the global responses and temperature sensitivities of all three major biogenic GHGs (CO2, CH4 and N2O) to warming and the potential driving factors have not been well synthesized across different biomes. We conducted a meta-analysis of 2423 globally obtained observations across multiple terrestrial ecosystems (i.e., forest, shrubland, grassland, wetland, cropland and tundra) from 224 published studies. Globally, experimental warming significantly stimulated soil GHG fluxes; soil CO2 and N2O emissions increased by 9.9% and 17.9%, respectively, and CH4 emissions in the lowland regions and CH4 uptakes in the upland regions increased by 10.1% and 7.5%, respectively, under warming. These increases amounted to 2289.0 kg, 31.0 kg, and 0.5 kg ha-1 year-1 of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions and 1.1 kg ha-1 year-1 of CH4 uptake per 1 °C globally, which translates to an additional emission of 30.3 Pg CO2 and 2.3 Pg CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) of CH4 and N2O fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems annually under 1 °C warming scenarios. We found that the responses and temperature sensitivities of GHG fluxes to warming were highly biome-dependent, and climate and warming duration also impacted the responses and temperature sensitivities of GHG fluxes. Moreover, warming also affected plant biomass, soil moisture, soil microbial substrate availability, and microbial biomass and function, and changes in soil moisture and plant biomass were related to the changes in GHG fluxes under warming. Our results provide strong empirical support that warming significantly increases soil GHG emissions and aboveground biomass but has no effect on soil carbon. Studies focus only on soil GHG fluxes, with no measurements of soil and plant carbon response, would overestimate the net impact of warming on the terrestrial carbon budget. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Geoderma,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.115865' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.115865</a>",,"What is the impact of climate warming on soil greenhouse gas fluxes?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,2,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

In this study, a total of 174 studies from 16 countries were collected and then a regression analysis was conducted to obtain the appropriate N fertilization rates that enhance crop yield while reducing GWP and GHGI. After that, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of NF on crop yield, GHGI, GWP and GHG emissions and identify NF management strategies that benefit crop yield and maintain GWP. The results showed that the suitable N fertilization rate was 180, 150, 130 and 200 kg ha−1 for wheat, maize, rice and vegetables or industrial crops, respectively. Overall, NF resulted in positive effect size in crop yield (0.56) and negative effect size in GHGI (−0.14) compared to NNF. GWP showed positive effect size (0.37) due to an increase in N2O emissions (0.91) relative to NNF, which is higher than the increase of CH4 emissions (0.01) and CO2 emissions (0.22).

This review aimed to comprehensively assess the changes in water use, yield, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions after AWD adoption and explore the optimal AWD water thresholds. Based on abundant data obtained from contrasting experiments between AWD and continuous flooding (CF) irrigation, the effects of AWD were quantified by stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR). The quantitative indices are the changes in total irrigation water (ΔIW), water productivity (ΔWP), grain yields (ΔGY), NUE indices, global warming potential (ΔGWP), and yield-scaled global warming potential (ΔYGWP) between AWD and CF. It was found that the ΔC-A (i.e. the difference between the CF and AWD thresholds) and soil types were the most noteworthy indicators affecting IW, water productivity, yield and partial factor productivity of N (PFPN). Meanwhile, the ΔC-A and fertilizer-N rates (NR) were two key indicators affecting GHG emissions. Thereafter, for different soil types, a group of optimization models were established to explore the optimal AWD water thresholds for optimizing ΔIW and ΔWP simultaneously without yield, NUE, and GHG emissions penalties. The results showed that the optimal upper limit of AWD (UAWD) should be equal to the upper limit of the CF (UCF), and the optimal lower limit of AWD (LAWD) can be obtained by the model. Taking the clay paddy field as an example, the min ΔIW were −41% to −8%, and the max ΔWP were 11%–54% after adopting optimal AWD water managements.

In this study, over 1,786 paired datasets (for meta-analysis) on land uses (LUs) were collected from Indian literature (1990-2019) to determine the magnitude of the influence of LUC on soil carbon, microbial biomass, and other physical and chemical properties at three soil depths. Meta-analysis results showed that grasslands (36.1%) lost the most soil organic carbon (SOC) compared to native forest lands, followed by plantation lands (35.5%), cultivated lands (31.1%), barren lands (27.3%), and horticulture lands (11.5%). Our findings also revealed that, when compared to forest land, the microbial quotient was lower in other LUs. Due to the depletion of SOC stock, carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq) emissions were significantly higher in all LUs than in forest land. Results also showed that due to the conversion of forest land to cultivated land, total carbon, labile carbon, non-labile carbon, microbial biomass carbon, and SOC stocks were lost by 21%, 25%, 32%, 26%, and 41.2%, respectively.

To reverse this trend, rewetting has been proposed as a climate change mitigation strategy. We performed a literature review to assess the empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that rewetting drained forested peatlands can turn them back into carbon sinks. We also used causal loop diagrams (CLDs) to synthesize the current knowledge of how water table management affects GHG emissions in organic soils. We found an increasing number of studies from the last decade comparing GHG emissions from rewetted, previously forested peatlands, with forested or pristine peatlands. However, comparative field studies usually report relatively short time series following rewetting experiments (e.g., 3 years of measurements and around 10 years after rewetting). Empirical evidence shows that rewetting leads to lower GHG emissions from soils. However, reports of carbon sinks in rewetted systems are scarce in the reviewed literature. Moreover, CH4 emissions in rewetted peatlands are commonly reported to be higher than in pristine peatlands. Long-term water table changes associated with rewetting lead to a cascade of effects in different processes regulating GHG emissions. The water table level affects litterfall quantity and quality by altering the plant community; it also affects organic matter breakdown rates, carbon and nitrogen mineralization pathways and rates, as well as gas transport mechanisms. Finally, we conceptualized three phases of restoration following the rewetting of previously drained and forested peatlands, we described the time dependent responses of soil, vegetation and GHG emissions to rewetting, concluding that while short-term gains in the GHG balance can be minimal, the long-term potential of restoring drained peatlands through rewetting remains promising.","FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.834371' target='_blank'>10.3389/fenvs.2022.834371</a>",,"What is the effect of rewetting drained and forested peatland on greenhouse gas emissions?",3,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Crop production models can provide helpful information on agricultural yields under a range of climate change scenarios and on the impact of adaptation strategies. Here, we report a systematic review of the impact of climate change on the yield of major staple crops in West Africa. Unlike earlier reviews we pay particular attention to the potential of common agricultural adaptation strategies (such as optimised planting dates, use of fertilisers and climate-resilient crop varieties) to mitigate the effects of climate change on crop yields. We systematically searched two databases for literature published between 2005 and 2020 and identified 35 relevant studies. We analysed yield changes of major staple crops (maize, sorghum, rice, millet, yam, cassava and groundnuts) caused by different climate change and field management scenarios. Yields declined by a median of 6% (-8% to +2% depending on the crop) due to climate change in all scenarios analysed. We show that the common adaptation strategies could increase crop yields affected by climate change by 13% (-4% to +19% depending on the strategy) as compared to business-as-usual field management practices, and that optimised planting dates and cultivars with longer crop cycle duration could in fact offset the negative effects of climate change on crop yields. Increased fertiliser use has not mitigated the impact of climate change on crops but could substantially increase yields now and in the future. Our results suggest that a combination of increased fertiliser use and adopting cropping practices that take advantage of favourable climate conditions have great potential to protect and enhance future crop production in West Africa.","ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac61c8' target='_blank'>10.1088/1748-9326/ac61c8</a>",,"What is the impact of climate change adaptation strategies on major crop yields in West Africa?",3,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

However, the effects of sulfonamide antibiotics introduced via manure and wastewater irrigation on nitrogen (N) loss in the soil-plant system remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a pot experiment to assess the effects of sulfamethazine (SMZ) and its degradation product (2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidine, ADPD) at four concentration gradients (i.e., 0, 1, 10, 100 mg kg−1) on nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) emissions, and the abundances of N-cycling functional genes and sulfonamide resistance genes. We also collated 350 observations from 62 published papers and performed a meta-analysis of antibiotic addition effects on N2O emission and soil net nitrification and denitrification. Antibiotics additions showed an inhibitory effect on N2O emissions, which accords with the trend of our meta-analysis showing a significant decrease of 32%. The decreased N2O emissions were attributed to the significant reduction in the abundances of total bacterial communities, ammonia oxidizers, and nir-type denitrifiers and to the resultant changes in soil inorganic N. N2O emissions did not differ between non-environmentally relevant concentrations for SMZ but lowered with increasing ADPD concentrations. This discrepancy can be explained by differential responses of the gene abundances of ammonia oxidizers and nirK-type denitrifiers and the development of antibiotic resistance genes in the highest concentration following antibiotic additions. Antibiotic additions increased soil NH3 volatilization but did not affect vegetable yield. Therefore, these findings provide insight into how the prevalence of antibiotics in soils could alter the N-cycling process and associated gas emissions, with implications for understanding the ecological risks of antibiotics in agriculture. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Science of the Total Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154230' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154230</a>",,"What are the effects of sulfonamide antibiotic exposure on nitrous oxide emission and soil net nitrification and denitrification from agricultural soils?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

A global meta-analysis","Wang, X.; Hu, H.-B.; Zheng, X.; Deng, W.-B.; Chen, J.-Y.; Zhang, S.; Cheng, C.",2022,"One of the main manifestations of global climate change is its profound impact on the emission of greenhouse gases from terrestrial soil. Numerous field warming experiments have explored the effects of different temperature rise intensities and durations on soil greenhouse gas fluxes in the growing season of different terrestrial ecosystems. However, the results were inconsistent due to the variations in vegetation, soil, and climatic conditions in different ecosystems. In the present work, we carried meta-analysis to synthesize 99 datasets from 52 field warming experiments in growing seasons of terrestrial ecosystems to evaluate the response of soil greenhouse gas fluxes to global warming. The results showed that warming greatly stimulated soil CO2 in temperate forest and farmland by 12.64% and 25.57%, respectively, significantly increased soil N2O emissions in grassland (27.23%), farmland (44.33%), and shrubland (223.36%), and increased soil CH4 uptake by 57.81% in grasslands. However, no significant impact on the greenhouse gas fluxes in other ecosystems was observed. Generally, short-and medium-term (≤ 3 years) warming can promote soil greenhouse gas fluxes. Also, low temperature and low-medium temperature (≤ 2 °C) significantly promoted N2O emission and CH4 absorption, and medium temperature (2–4 °C) considerably assisted CO2 flux, but high temperature (&gt; 4 °C) had no significant effect on greenhouse gas flux. Our results demonstrated that soil greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems during the growing season do not increase linearly with the increasing climate warming, and it is still uncertain whether there is acclimatization to long-term climate warming. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Science of the Total Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154114' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154114</a>",,"What is the impact of warming on soil greenhouse gas fluxes in a range of terrestrial habitats?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Nevertheless, a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of the responses of soil C and N dynamics to elevated [O-3] remains elusive. In this study, the results of 41 peer-reviewed studies were synthesized using meta-analytic techniques, to quantify the impact of O-3 on ten variables associated with soil C and N, i.e. total C (TC, including soil organic C), total N (TN), dissolved organic C (DOC), ammonia N (NH4 (+)), nitrate N (NO3 (-)), microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), rates of nitrification (NTF) and denitrification (DNF), as well as C/N ratio. The results depicted that all these variables showed significant changes (P < 0.05) with [O-3] increased by 27.6 +/- 18.7 nl l(-1) (mean +/- SD), including decreases in TC, DOC, TN, NH4 (+), MBC, MBN and NTF, and increases in C/N, NO3 (-) and DNF. The effect sizes of TN, NTF, and DNF were significantly correlated with O-3 fumigation levels and experimental duration (P < 0.05). Soil pH and climate were essential in analyses of O-3 impacts on soil C and N. However, the responses of most variables to elevated [O-3] were generally independent of the O-3 fumigation method, terrestrial ecosystem type, and additional [CO2] exposure. The altered soil C and N dynamics under elevated [O-3] may reduce its C sink capacity, and change soil N availability and thus, impact plant growth and enhance soil N losses.","ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac49b9' target='_blank'>10.1088/1748-9326/ac49b9</a>",,"What is the impact of elevated tropospheric ozone on variables associated with soil carbon and nitrogen?",3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis on the response of soil C cycling and storage across soil profiles (organic layer, 0-5 cm, 0-10 cm, 0-20 cm, and 20-100 cm) to fire reported in 308 studies across 383 sites and examined the role of fire frequency, fire type, soil type, ecosystem type, and post-fire time in regulating the response of soil C dynamics to fire. Overall, we found soil C cycling and storage were more responsive to one fire and wildfire as compared to frequent fire and prescribed fire, respectively. Soil respiration significantly decreased by 22 +/- 9% by one fire, but was not significantly affected by frequent fire across ecosystems. One fire significantly reduced soil C content in the organic, 0-10 cm, and 20-100 cm layers by 27 +/- 16%, 10 +/- 9%, and 33 +/- 18%, respectively, while frequent fire significantly reduced soil C content at a depth of 0-5 cm and 0-20 cm by 29 +/- 8% and 16 +/- 12%, respectively. Soil C cycling and storage showed little response to frequent prescribed fire. In addition, the response of soil C cycling and storage varied among different soil and ecosystem types, with a stronger response being observed in forest than in grassland. Within 20 years post-fire, soil C cycling and storage tended to recover only after one fire but not after frequent fire. We also found that soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities were more responsive to one fire than frequent fire, which could indirectly affect the effects of fire on soil C cycling and storage.

Nonetheless, the impact of the combination of warming and precipitation changes on all three major biogenic GHGs (CO2, CH4 and N2O) has not been synthesized, to build a global synthesis. In this study, we conducted a global meta-analysis concerning the effects of warming and precipitation changes and their interactions on soil GHG fluxes and explored the potential factors by synthesizing 39 published studies worldwide. Across all studies, combination of warming and increased precipitation showed more significant effect on CO2 emissions (24.0%) than the individual effect of warming (8.6%) and increased precipitation (20.8%). Additionally, warming increased N2O emissions (28.3%), and decreased precipitation reduced CO2 (−8.5%) and N2O (−7.1%) emissions, while the combination of warming and decreased precipitation also showed negative effects on CO2 (−7.6%) and N2O (−14.6%) emissions. The interactive effects of warming and precipitation changes on CO2 emissions were usually additive, whereas CO2 and N2O emissions were dominated by synergistic effects under warming and decreased precipitation. Moreover, climate, biome, duration, and season of manipulations also affected soil GHG fluxes as well. Furthermore, we also found the threshold effects of changes in soil temperature and moisture on CO2 and N2O emissions under warming and precipitation changes.

Trophic differences in response to climate change may disrupt ecological interactions and thereby threaten marine ecosystem function. Yet, we still do not have a comprehensive understanding of how different trophic levels respond to climate change stressors in marine ecosystems. By including 1278 experiments, comprising 236 different marine species from 18 different phyla in a meta-analysis of studies measuring the direct effect of ocean acidification and ocean warming on marine organisms, we found that higher trophic level species display greater tolerance to ocean acidification but greater sensitivity to warming. In contrast, marine herbivores were the most vulnerable trophic level to both acidification and warming. Such imbalances in the community and a general reduction of biodiversity and biomass in lower trophic levels can significantly disrupt the system and could drive negative bottom-up effects.

Tillage can affect a variety of soil-mediated processes, e.g., soil carbon sequestration (SCS) or depletion, greenhouse gas (GHG) (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emission, and water pollution. Several tillage practices are in vogue globally, and they exhibit varied impacts on these processes. Hence, there is a dire need to synthesize, collate and comprehensively present these interlinked phenomena to facilitate future researches. This study deals with the co-benefits and trade-offs produced by several tillage practices on SCS and related soil properties, GHG emissions, and water quality. We hypothesized that improved tillage practices could enable agriculture to contribute to SCS and mitigate GHG emissions and leaching of nutrients and pesticides. Based on our current understanding, we conclude that sustainable soil moisture level and soil temperature management is crucial under different tillage practices to offset leaching loss of soil stored nutrients/pesticides, GHG emissions and ensuring SCS. For instance, higher carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) could be attributed to the fluctuations in soil moisture and temperature regimes. In addition, NT may enhance nitrate (NO3−) leaching over CT because of improved soil structure, infiltration capacity, and greater water flux, however, suggesting that the eutrophication potential of NT is high. Our study indicates that the evaluation of the eutrophication potential of different tillage practices is still overlooked. Our study suggests that improving tillage practices in terms of mitigation of N2O emission and preventing NO3− pollution may be sustainable if nitrification inhibitors are applied. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Science of the Total Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154161' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154161</a>",,"What are the effects of various tillage practices on leaching loss of soil stored nutrients/pesticides, greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration?",3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,"Evidence Review"

 Minimizing the impact of ocean acidification requires an understanding of species responses and environmental variability of population habitats. Whereas the literature is growing rapidly, emerging results suggest unresolved species- or population-specific responses. Here we present a meta-analysis synthesizing experimental studies examining the effects of pCO(2) on biological traits in marine invertebrates. At the sampling locations of experimental animals, we determined environmental pCO(2) conditions by integrating data from global databases and pCO(2) measurements from buoys. Experimental pCO(2) scenarios were compared with upper pCO(2) using an index considering the upper environmental pCO(2). For most taxa, a statistically significant negative linear relationship was observed between this index and mean biological responses, indicating that the impact of a given experimental pCO(2) scenario depends on the deviation from the upper pCO(2) level experienced by local populations.

Differences in lifehistory, physical traits, and the phenotypic response of organisms will, however, mean that the effects of OA and OW will differ among species. Geographical differences in environmental characteristics across habitats will also influence the effects of OA and OW, thereby driving inter-population differences in phenotypic response as determined by local adaptations. While is it accepted that the response of species will vary globally, predicting the trends in response of species remains highly uncertain. We undertook a meta-analysis of key biological traits of 47 marine copepod species from 88 studies to identify the intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing the effects of OA and OW on copepod population demographics. Data from OA and OW were analysed independently due to insufficient two-stressor studies. We found that the large disparity in the response of species to OA and OW is largely defined by their environmental history. Additionally, the response of copepod species to OW is related to their evolutionary history which has less influence on their response to OA. Therefore, our study identified that the response of copepods to OA is driven by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors in their habitats. Under OA alone, copepods from less variable environments may be more susceptible, but the effects of OA will only be strongly negative at extreme low pH (<7). On the other hand, the response to OW is deeply tied to their phylogeny, whereby closely related species share similar costs and trade-offs. However, the effects of near-future OW (+2 to 4 degrees C) seem mainly positive unless these temperatures exceed a species' thermal limit. Finally, our analysis revealed that OW has a greater influence on key copepod traits than OA. Overall, this study shows that attempting to draw global patterns in the response of species to climate change from a single species or habitat without consideration of environmental and evolutionary history could lead to inaccurate and misleading predictions with respect to the future of biological communities.","OCEANOGRAPHY AND MARINE BIOLOGY: AN ANNUAL REVIEW, VOL 59","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003138846' target='_blank'>10.1201/9781003138846</a>",,"What is the impact of ocean acidification and warming on copepod ecology?",3,1,3,3,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Among the possible consequences, a series of studies on coral reef fish suggested that the direct effects of acidification on fish behavior may be extreme and have broad ecological ramifications. Recent studies documenting a lack of effect of experimental ocean acidification on fish behavior, however, call this prediction into question. Indeed, the phenomenon of decreasing effect sizes over time is not uncommon and is typically referred to as the “decline effect.” Here, we explore the consistency and robustness of scientific evidence over the past decade regarding direct effects of ocean acidification on fish behavior. Using a systematic review and meta-analysis of 91 studies empirically testing effects of ocean acidification on fish behavior, we provide quantitative evidence that the research to date on this topic is characterized by a decline effect, where large effects in initial studies have all but disappeared in subsequent studies over a decade. The decline effect in this field cannot be explained by 3 likely biological explanations, including increasing proportions of studies examining (1) cold-water species; (2) nonolfactory-associated behaviors; and (3) nonlarval life stages. Furthermore, the vast majority of studies with large effect sizes in this field tend to be characterized by low sample sizes, yet are published in high-impact journals and have a disproportionate influence on the field in terms of citations. We contend that ocean acidification has a negligible direct impact on fish behavior, and we advocate for improved approaches to minimize the potential for a decline effect in future avenues of research.

The snow cover in the HA is involved in climate feedbacks that influence the global climate system, and greatly impacts the hydrology and the ecosystems of the coldest biomes of the Northern Hemi-sphere. The ongoing global warming trend and its polar amplification is threatening the long-term stability of the snow cover in the HA. This study presents an extensive review of the literature on observed and projected snow cover conditions in the High Arctic region. Several key snow cover metrics were reviewed, including snowfall, snow cover duration (SCD), snow cover extent (SCE), snow depth (SD), and snow water equivalent (SWE) since 1930 based on in situ, remote sensing and simulations results. Changes in snow metrics were reviewed and outlined from the continental to the local scale. The reviewed snow metrics displayed different sensitivities to past and projected changes in precipitation and air temperature. Despite the overall increase in snowfall, both observed from historical data and projected into the future, some snow cover metrics displayed consistent decreasing trends, with SCE and SCD showing the most widespread and steady decreases over the last century in the HA, particularly in the spring and summer seasons. However, snow depth and, in some regions SWE, have mostly increased; nevertheless, both SD and SWE are projected to decrease by 2030. By the end of the century, the extent of Arctic spring snow cover will be considerably less than today (10–35%). Model simulations project higher winter snowfall, higher or lower maximum snow depth depending on regions, and a shortened snow season by the end of the century. The spatial pattern of snow metrics trends for both historical and projected climates exhibit notice-able asymmetry among the different HA sectors, with the largest observed and anticipated changes occurring over the Canadian HA. © 2022 by the authors.

Here, we perform a meta-analysis and machine learning algorithm with data from China, a global hotspot for agricultural NH3 emissions, to quantify the effects of OCA on NH3 emissions, crop yields and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). We find that the effects of OCA depend on soil and climate conditions, and the 40-60% substitution of synthetic fertilizers with livestock manure achieves the maximum cobenefits of enhanced crop production and reduced NH3 emissions.

Actions representing alternatives to business-as-usual trend can reduce negative impacts, but their effectiveness across ecosystems, climatic zones and scales is unclear. Here, we analyse how land recovery and climate action can counteract adverse effects of current trends on nature and safeguard provisioning of ecosystem services. Using a meta-analysis approach, we compiled 410 estimates of how land recovery or climate action may alter impacts expected from business-as-usual trends. We show that both alternatives can reduce negative effects on several nature indicators. The magnitude of the effects, however, is context-dependent, revealing their potential complementarity. Land recovery showed highest benefits in terrestrial and freshwater systems in temperate zones and mostly acts at subnational scale. Contrastingly, climate action is more important in coastal and oceanic systems and in tropical regions, where benefits are larger on a regional to global scale. Our results show that land recovery and climate action will be imperative to reduce risks that would be imposed on nature by business-as-usual trends otherwise. We conclude that a better evaluation of which contexts are best suited for certain actions is a first step towards securing nature and the ecosystem services necessary to guarantee human well-being and the fulfilment of the sustainability agenda. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Regional Environmental Change","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-021-01866-z' target='_blank'>10.1007/s10113-021-01866-z</a>","Business-as-usual scenario; Climate change; Global change; Human well-being; Land-use change","What are the impacts of alternative climate action scenarios on ecosystem service indicators?",3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Through a global review of research on liming of grasslands, the objective of this paper was to assess the impacts of liming on soil pH, grass biomass production and total net GHG exchange (nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and net carbon dioxide (CO2)). We collected 57 studies carried out at 88 sites and covering different countries and climatic zones. All of the studies examined showed that liming either reduced or had no effects on the emissions of two potent greenhouse gases (N2O and CH4). Though liming of grasslands can increase net CO2 emissions, the impact on total net GHG emission is minimal due to the higher global warming potential, over a 100-year period, of N2O and CH4 compared to that of CO2. Liming grassland delivers many potential advantages, which justify its wider adoption. It significantly ameliorates soil acidity, increases grass productivity, reduces fertiliser requirement and increases species richness. To realise the maximum benefit of liming grassland, we suggest that acidic soils should be moderately limed within the context of specific climates, soils and management. © 2022","Environmental Pollution","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.118999' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.envpol.2022.118999</a>",,"What are the effects of liming grasslands on soil pH, grass biomass production and greenhouse gas exchanges?",3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Although nematodes play a critical role in material cycles and soil food webs, the overall trend and magnitude of changes in nematode responses to global change remain unclear. In this study, we synthesized nematode responses to the major global change factors (i.e., nitrogen (N) deposition, climate warming, elevated CO2, and drought) using data extracted from published global change experiments. We found that nematode and soil micro-food web responses differed among the global change scenarios. Specifically, N addition significantly decreased generic richness (−9%) and the abundance of fungivores (−14%) and omnivore-predators (−26%). Warming had minor effects on soil nematodes. Elevated CO2 significantly increased total nematode abundance (20%), the abundance of fungivores (42%) and herbivores (22%), and the ratio of fungivorous nematodes/bacterivorous nematodes (32%) but decreased nematode generic richness. Drought reduced total nematode abundance (−20%). Soil nematode responses to global change factors were influenced by the experimental system (i.e., ecosystem types and experimental duration) and environmental factors (i.e., mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and latitude). Our synthesis indicates that soil pH, NH4+ content, N-application rate, ecosystem types, and experimental duration may be the main factors explaining the negative effects of N addition on soil nematodes, and that the warming effects may be best explained by soil moisture and ecosystem types. These findings can help to better predict how global change factors affect soil nematodes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108538' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108538</a>",,"What is the effect of global change on soil nematodes?",2,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

In this study, we examine how plant diversity regulates the responses of grassland productivity to experimental warming using meta-analytic techniques. Location: Global. Major taxa studied: Grassland ecosystems. Methods: Our meta-analysis is based on warming responses of 40 different plant communities obtained from 20 independent studies on grasslands across five continents. Results: Our results show that plant diversity and its responses to warming were the most important factors regulating the warming effects on plant productivity, among all the factors considered (plant diversity, climate and experimental settings). Specifically, warming increased plant productivity when plant diversity (indicated by effective number of species) in grasslands was lower than 10, whereas warming decreased plant productivity when plant diversity was greater than 10. Moreover, the structural equation modelling showed that the magnitude of warming enhanced plant productivity by increasing the performance of dominant plant species in grasslands of diversity lower than 10. The negative effects of warming on productivity in grasslands with plant diversity greater than 10 were partly explained by diversity-induced decline in plant dominance. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that the positive or negative effect of warming on grassland productivity depends on how biodiverse a grassland is. This may mainly be due to differences in how warming may affect plant dominance and subsequent shifts in interspecific interactions in grasslands of different plant diversity levels. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Global Ecology and Biogeography","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.13441' target='_blank'>10.1111/geb.13441</a>",,"What is the effect of climate warming on grassland productivity?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"
127208,"Reversion of Perennial Biomass Crops to Conserve C and N: A Meta-Analysis","Martani, E.; Ferrarini, A.; Amaducci, S.",2022,"Perennial crops have been proposed as a solution to couple the production of sustainable biomass for multiple uses with several environmental benefits such as soil C storage. Concerns exist that the C sequestered in soil could be lost in a few years after the perennial crops are reverted to arable land. In this study, the current knowledge on the effects of perennial crop reversion on soil C and N was summarized by performing a meta-analysis. One year after the reversion a significant increase of soil C and N stocks (+15% and +12% respectively) were found in the 0–30 cm layer, while in the time interval between the second to fifth year after the reversion, there were no significant increases or decreases of soil C and N. The incorporation of the belowground biomass (BGB) into the soil at reversion plays a key role in the fate of soil C and N stocks after the reversion. In fact, when reverting a multiannual biomass crop there are significant losses of soil C and N. In contrast, when reverting a perennial biomass crop (PBCs) such as rhizomatous herbaceous or SRC woody crops there are no losses of soil C and N. The BGB of perennial grass is mainly composed of root systems and not of a huge amount of belowground organs as in the case of PBCs. The shredding of the BGB and its transformation as particulate organic matter (POM) represent the major pulse C input at the reversion that can undergo further stabilization into a mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) fraction. Introducing PBCs into crop rotation resulted in an effective carbon farming solution with a potential positive legacy for food crops in terms of achievement of both climate and soil fertility goals. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the general patterns of how plant input changes affect them in forests remain unclear. By conducting a meta-analysis of 3193 observations from 166 experiments worldwide, we found that alterations in aboveground litter and/or root inputs had profound effects on soil carbon and microbial communities in forest ecosystems. Litter addition stimulated soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and microbial biomass, whereas removal of litter, roots or both (no inputs) decreased them. The increased SOC under litter addition suggested that aboveground litter inputs benefit SOC sequestration despite accelerated decomposition. Unlike root removal, litter alterations and no inputs altered particulate organic carbon, whereas all detrital treatments did not significantly change mineral-associated organic carbon. In addition, detrital treatments contrastingly altered soil microbial community, with litter addition or removal shifting it toward fungi, whereas root removal shifting it toward bacteria. Furthermore, the responses of soil carbon and microbial biomass to litter alterations positively correlated with litter input rate and total litter input, suggesting that litter input quantity is a critical controller of belowground processes. Taken together, these findings provide critical insights into understanding how altered plant productivity and allocation affects soil carbon cycling, microbial communities and functioning of forest ecosystems under global changes. Future studies can take full advantage of the existing plant detritus experiments and should focus on the relative roles of litter and roots in forming SOC and its fractions.","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16107' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.16107</a>",,"What is the impact of change in plant inputs and soil organic carbon?",3,1,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,2,3,"Evidence Review"

However, crop residues can also potentially stimulate emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) from soils. A better understanding of how to mitigate N2O emissions due to crop residue management while promoting positive effects on soil carbon is needed to reconcile the opposing effects of crop residues on the greenhouse gas balance of agroecosystems. Here, we combine a literature review and a meta-analysis to identify and assess measures for mitigating N2O emissions due to crop residue application to agricultural fields. Our study shows that crop residue removal, shallow incorporation, incorporation of residues with C:N ratio &gt; 30 and avoiding incorporation of residues from crops terminated at an immature physiological stage, are measures leading to significantly lower N2O emissions. Other practices such as incorporation timing and interactions with fertilisers are less conclusive. Several of the evaluated N2O mitigation measures implied negative side-effects on yield, soil organic carbon storage, nitrate leaching and/or ammonia volatilization. We identified additional strategies with potential to reduce crop residue N2O emissions without strong negative side-effects, which require further research. These are: a) treatment of crop residues before field application, e.g., conversion of residues into biochar or anaerobic digestate, b) co-application with nitrification inhibitors or N-immobilizing materials such as compost with a high C:N ratio, paper waste or sawdust, and c) use of residues obtained from crop mixtures.

A meta-analysis was undertaken to evaluate the effects of warming (including the magnitude, methods, and duration of warming) and environmental factors (including climate, soils, and plants) on the response of Rs to warming in grasslands, using a global dataset of 168 independent measurements. Multi-model inference, an information-theoretical method for synthesizing results of multiple alternative models, was used to quantify the relative importance of the environmental factors. We found that the response of Rs to warming followed a three-phase pattern: Rs increased initially, then remained unchanged, and then increased again as the duration of warming increased. The long-term response was greater than the short-term response. The Rs response was also affected by the method of warming, with open-top chambers promoting Rs more than infrared heaters. The response of Rs to warming was also positively related to the magnitude of warming. Rs was greatly increased with warming in temperate grasslands compared with that in cold grasslands but did not change significantly in arid grasslands. According to multi-model inference, this can be attributable to differences in soil nutrients and the mean annual precipitation. Our findings suggest a greater long-term stimulation of Rs in a warming world than we previously thought, so short-term studies cannot provide a reliable scientific basis for carbon projections under long-term climate warming.

To fill this important research gap, a global meta-analysis was conducted in-cluding 64 studies with 736 individual treatments. Field experiments covered experimental durations between 1 and 10 years with biochar application amounts between 1 and 100 Mg ha−1. They showed a mean increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks by 13.0 Mg ha−1 on average, corresponding to 29%. Pot and incubation experiments ranged between 1 and 1278 days and biochar amounts between 5 g kg−1 and 200 g kg−1. They raised SOC by 6.3 g kg−1 on average, corresponding to 75%.

Using a meta-analysis approach, we compiled 410 estimates of how land recovery or climate action may alter impacts expected from business-as-usual trends. We show that both alternatives can reduce negative effects on several nature indicators. The magnitude of the effects, however, is context-dependent, revealing their potential complementarity. Land recovery showed highest benefits in terrestrial and freshwater systems in temperate zones and mostly acts at subnational scale. Contrastingly, climate action is more important in coastal and oceanic systems and in tropical regions, where benefits are larger on a regional to global scale.

This paper is the first comprehensive review on the assessment of biomass type and the biochars' properties effects on N recovery efficiency from aqueous solutions as well as its release and availability for plants when applying the N-enriched chars in soils. In particular, the N recovery efficiency by raw biochars versus the type of the raw feedstock is summarized.

Soil microbial community (SMC) play a major role in C cycling and their activity has been considered as the main driver of differences in the potential to store C in soils. The composition of the SMC is crucial for the maintenance of soil ecosystem services, as the structure and activity of SMC also regulates the turnover and delivery of nutrients, as well as the rate of decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). Quantifying the impact of agricultural practices on both SMC and SCS is key to improve sustainability of soil management. Hence, we discuss the impact of farming practices improving SCS by altering SMC, SOM, and soil aggregates, unraveling their inter-and intra-relationships. Using quantitative and process driven insights from 197 peer-reviewed publications leads to the conclusion that the net benefits from agricultural management to improve SCS would not be sustainable if we overlook the role of soil microbial community. Reintroduction of the decayed microbial community to agricultural soils is crucial for enhancing long-term C storage potential of soils and stabilize them over time. The interactions among SMC, SOM, soil aggregates, and agricultural activities still require more knowledge and research to understand their full contribution to the SCS. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, the sustainability of these landscapes is threatened by climate change. Whilst adopting climate-smart (CS) practices clearly offers direct benefits to local farmers, their greater benefits at landscape and global scales has not been studied for specific commodity crops so far. Our research uniquely outlines how local adoption of CS-practices in coffee-farming systems provides local, landscape and global benefits. We review literature on CS agriculture, CS landscapes, and coffee farming to firstly identify the different CS-practices applicable to coffee farming systems, and then group these into functional groups that represent the main functional trait targeted by different practices within coffee-farming systems. This allows identifying benefits provided at local, landscape and global scales. The seven functional groups identified are: soil characteristics; water management; crop and genetic diversity; climate buffer and adjustment; crop nutrient management; structural elements and natural habitats; and system functioning. Benefits offered at landscape and global scales (non-exhaustively) include improved water quality, biodiversity conservation and habitat connectivity, as well as stabilized regional climate patterns. Our review shows that regulating services are especially pronounced, although the extent of benefits provided depend on landscape coordination. We discuss considerations for managing possible conflicts, coordinating actions, financing and accommodating lead time. Local farmers, policy-makers and global donors must unite to improve uptake of CS coffee-production practices in a coordinated way, to thereby augment and safeguard coffee-farming's socio-ecological system along with associated local, landscape and global benefits.

Previous work has shown that carbon stocks of grassland soils have been largely depleted worldwide due to missuse or mismanagement but that shifts in management could also potentially increase soil carbon stocks and mitigate against the degradation of natural ecosystems. However, the existing literature points to large discrepancies in the impact of grassland management practices on soil carbon, which the present study investigated. Here we considered 235 experimental sites in 18 countries across the world where shifts in grassland management involved different grazing strategies (free, F vs controlled, C; high, H vs low, L density grazers), grazers exclusion (E), mowing (M) and burning (B). The best performing practice was controlled grazing with high density of grazers (CHG) with an average soil organic carbon content (SOCC) increase of 21% and with 100% of the studies pointing to a SOCC increase. This was followed by E (14.9%; 60%) and FLG (13.3%; 80%). On average, burning grasslands, decreases SOCC by 9.3% but 31% of the studies pointed to an increase, thus indicating discrepancies in the impact of grassland management. CLG and mowing did not significantly impact SOCC. These results also indicated that B decreased SOCC the most under moist to humid climates (-10.9% vs -1.7% under arid to semi-arid), while that E was only beneficial in arid to semi-arid grasslands. Adoption of rotational high-intensity grazing in place of free grazing grasslands, should be seriously considered by policy and decision makers to mitigate against climate change while fostering economic and social development.

In the wake of climate change and its diverse global effects, fragmentation and degradation of tropical forests have jeopardized their ability to support livelihoods and regenerate climate regulating services. Concerted efforts by local, national, and international players, which are primarily scientific, technological, or economic, have borne minimal results in safeguarding these forests from destruction, necessitating a more integrated and inclusive approach. The Rio Earth Summit (1992) brought together world leaders to set targets and priorities on the global sustainability agenda and laid a strong foundation for international policy cooperation in the future. This study employed a systematic review of articles published between 1992 and 2020 to establish how various policy mechanisms have been developed and evolved to bridge forests and climate change discourse in tropical forests while highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. The initial search of peer-reviewed publications and gray literature yielded 2622 records, which were subjected to inclusion and exclusion criteria based on The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta Analyses guidelines, resulting in a final list of 65 records for in-depth qualitative analysis. The study establishes that the mechanisms in place have contributed mainly to more coordination and incentives to manage climate risks, primarily through tropical forests conservation. However, hurdles such as inadequate participation and involvement of the local and indigenous people, insufficient national and local policy frameworks and bureaucracies around emissions monitoring, measuring, reporting, and verification processes continue to slow tropical forest conservation. Thus, there is a need for more integrated, multilevel, and diverse stakeholder engagement to achieve the set global targets effectively.

Here we develop a comprehensive understanding of species richness modification due to management (mowing) and climate (warming) variations worldwide, and present the results of two meta-analyses from 999 and 1793 records (articles). Recorded articles had at least one experiment with a case-control design. The results show that both mowing (43 articles) and warming (34 articles) modify species richness, which on average increased by c. 32% with once-a-year mowing (against no mowing) and declined by c. 13% with warming (against ambient temperature). Our meta-analysis on the mowing regime supports the humped-back model, with one or two cuts per year being the level of disturbance optimising species richness. We also observed that warming-induced reduction in species richness is lower in dry climates (< 300 mm yr(-1)) and at low elevations (< 1000 m a.s.l.). Where available, we accounted for harvested biomass as a concomitant variable and we found that overall it decreased by c. 21% (mowing) and increased by c. 11% (warming). The evidence provided of an opposite response of species richness and harvested biomass to disturbance is consistent with the competitive-exclusion hypothesis of negatively correlated patterns between the two outcomes (high taxonomic diversity with low biomass production, and vice versa). The reported difficulties in finding representative studies in previous meta-analyses and in the present ones highlight the need to orient future research towards long-term experiments on the combined effects of mowing and warming for a more robust inference of environmental and management constraints on grassland performance.","AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-021-00722-y' target='_blank'>10.1007/s13593-021-00722-y</a>",,"What are the effects of climate (warming) variations on grassland species richness?",3,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,2,3,"Evidence Review"

However, there has been no systematic analysis of the impacts of NT on soil aggregation and aggregate-associated soil organic carbon (SOC) at global level. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 89 publications to elucidate the changes in soil aggregation and aggregate-associated SOC under NT. Notably, we quantified the roles of diverse environmental and agronomic factors (e.g., climatic conditions, experimental duration, cropping intensity, soil texture, and initial SOC/pH) in the changes in those variables. Relative to conventional tillage (CT), NT significantly increased the proportions of water-stable large (LM) and small (SM) macro-aggregates and the mean weight diameter (MWD) (by 49%, 11%, and 23%, respectively) but decreased the proportions of micro-aggregates (MIC) and silt plus clay-size particles (SC) (by 11% and 16%, respectively). NT significantly enhanced SOC concentrations in LM (17%), SM (14%), MIC (10%), and SC (7%) compared to CT. Furthermore, the random forest (RF) model demonstrated that climatic conditions, experimental duration, and soil texture were the predominant factors controlling the changes in aggregation and aggregate-associated SOC under NT. Overall, our results indicate that NT is an effective strategy to enhance soil aggregation and aggregate-associated SOC, yet variations in responses are determined by specific environmental/agronomic factors.

Although previous studies have largely attributed this phenomenon to the increased organic C inputs, the potential mechanisms of how N enrichment increases soil organic C (SOC) remain contentious. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis comprising 234 published field N-addition experiments from multiple terrestrial ecosystems across China to evaluate the impacts of N enrichment on the SOC budget. Although the meta-analysis revealed that N-addition significantly enhanced plant biomass and SOC concentration across the selected studies, we found that SOC concentration was independent of, or even decreased with, the enhanced plant biomass due to increased soil C loss as increasing organic C inputs. The negative correlation between plant C inputs and SOC under N enrichment, meanwhile, appeared reversible by the concomitant changes in soil pH, which depended on the magnitude of soil acidification. Increased SOC in terrestrial ecosystems was closely associated with decreased soil pH, which reduced soil C losses by limiting microbial degradation. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that soil carbon (C) budget is determined by the trade-off between plant C inputs and nitrogen (N)-induced soil acidification.

Although eCO2 generally stimulates GHG emissions in the short term (&lt;5 years) experiments, the responses to long-term (≥10 years) eCO2 remain poorly known. Here we show, through a series of experiments and meta-analysis, that the eCO2 does not necessarily increase CH4 and N2O emissions from rice paddies. In an experiment of free-air CO2 enrichment for 13–15 years, CH4 and N2O emissions were decreased by 11–54% and 33–54%, respectively. The decline of CH4 emissions was related to the reduction of CH4 production and enhancement of CH4 oxidation via raising soil Eh and soil-water interface [O2] under eCO2. Moreover, the eCO2 significantly decreased NH4+-N content, suggesting a reduction of soil nitrification and thereby N2O emissions. A meta-analysis showed that CH4 and N2O emissions were stimulated under short-term eCO2 while reduced under long-term eCO2. The eCO2-induced increase in yield and biomass and the ratio of mcrA genes/pmoA genes declined with eCO2 duration, indicating an eCO2-stimulation of methanogenesis lower than that of methanotrophy over time by fewer increased substrates.

Across the dataset, eCO2 increased microbial richness and diversity by 40.5% and 4.6%, respectively; warming and N addition decreased the abundance of denitrification functional genes (nirS, nirK, and nozS); N addition had a greater impact on soil C-cycling functional genes than on N-cycling ones. Long-term precipitation change was conducive to the increase in soil microbial richness, and fungal richness change was more sensitive than bacterial richness, but the sensitivity of bacteria richness to N addition was positively correlated with experimental duration. Soil microbial richness, diversity, and functional gene abundances could be significantly affected by individual or multiple GCF changes, and their interactions are mainly additive. W×eCO2 on microbial diversity, and N×PPT+ and W×N on N-cycling functional gene abundance showed synergistic interactions.

A meta-analysis","Gatica, G.; Elena Fernández, M.; Paula Juliarena, M.; Gyenge, J.",2022,"Evidence suggests that tree plantations change soil methane (CH4) fluxes (magnitude and/or direction of the fluxes) compared to herbaceous land (i.e. afforestation effect) due to the effect of trees increasing methanotroph bacteria abundance and enhancing soil gas diffusivity. However, the magnitude of this afforestation effect is highly variable across studies. Here, we evaluated whether the variation in the afforestation effect depends on forestry management strategies, described by stand age and density, as well as taxonomic identity of the tree species, and the interaction with climatic conditions. To this end, we conducted a meta-analysis using 47 paired samples of afforested and contiguous herbaceous land from 14 studies located in different biomes worldwide. We found that afforestation predominantly increases the capacity of soil net CH4 uptake (i.e. more negative fluxes) compared to herbaceous land, but the magnitude of this effect was highly heterogeneous across paired samples. This heterogeneity was explained by environmental conditions, but significant effects of forest stand age and density were also found proving the importance of forest management on this ecological service. Soil net CH4 uptake following afforestation increases with increasing stand age. Although the stand stocking effect could be tested with a limited number of studies (24 out of the 47 paired samples), the results suggest that net CH4 uptake decreases with tree stocking (stand density) in the range of values up to 1500 individuals per ha. No change in CH4 fluxes was observed above this high stand density. Contrary to our expectations, no effect of taxonomic identity of the trees considering the most planted genera (Pinus and Eucalyptus) was observed in the average soil CH4 fluxes. Furthermore, a significant correlation between the afforestation effect on soil water content and CH4 flux suggests that the most plausible cause of the increased soil net CH4 uptake is driven by the forest impact on soil desiccation, which in turn increases in sites with higher water limitation (i.e. higher potential evapotranspiration and high temporal rainfalls variations within the ranges of the available studies). Finally, our study provides evidence that by modifying rotation time and stand stocking, afforested land may increase its environmental service as a sink of atmospheric CH4. © 2022

Results showed that acid rain significantly decreased soil CO2 emission by 11.7%, but marginally increased soil N2O emission by 11.7%. In addition, acid rain significantly decreased soil pH, dissolved organic carbon (C), microbial biomass C, nitrate nitrogen (N), hydrolysable N and total phosphorus, while increased soil organic C, ammonium N and C/N ratio. Moreover, acid rain significantly decreased the activity of soil urease, sucrase and invertase. Acid rain significantly decreased soil bacterial and gram-negative bacterial biomass, while increased the microbial biomass of gram-positive bacteria, fungi and actinomycete, and the ratios of fungi/bacteria and gram-positive/gramnegative bacteria. Furthermore, acid rain significantly decreased the aboveground biomass and fine root biomass of vegetation. The effect size of soil CO2 emission had significantly positive relationships with that of soil pH, microbial biomass C, urease activity, and fine root biomass, while it negatively related with that of soil organic C and C/N ratio. These findings suggest that acid rain reduces soil CO2 emission and promotes soil organic C accumulation.

In croplands, N addition increased N2O emissions (109%), the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) (19%), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (95%), nirK (52%), nirS (40%) and nosZ (41%), and the diversity of AOB (15%), nirS (12%) and nosZ (11%). In grassland, N addition increased AOB abundance (130%) and decreased the abundance of nirS (−99%) and nosZ (−58%) genes, but in forests, significant effects were only found for the abundance of AOA (35%) and AOB (121%). N2O emission was negatively correlated with the abundance of nosZ, but positively correlated with the abundance of AOA and AOB. Apart from the abundance of functional AOA, AOB and nosZ genes, climate variables (precipitation and temperature), and available N concentrations were the main factors explaining the variation in N2O emission with N addition, as shown by random forest analysis. These findings indicate that impacts on N functional genes that encode enzymes involved in nitrification (AOA, AOB) and in the transformation of N2O to N2 (nosZ) are the main mechanisms behind the effect on N fertilizer-induced N2O emissions. © 2021","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108523' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108523</a>",,"What are the impacts of Nitrogen addition on nitrous oxide emissions, abundance and diversity of Nitrogen functional genes and nitrification/denitrification rates in soils?",3,1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"

However, the impact of eCO2 on the N2O emission from agricultural soils remains poorly understood. This meta-analysis summarizes the effect of eCO2 on N2O emission in agricultural ecosystems and soil physiochemical and biological characteristics using 50 publications selected. The eCO2 effect values, which equal to the percentage changes of N2O emission under eCO2, were calculated based on the natural logarithm of the response ratio to eCO2. We found that eCO2 significantly increased N2O emission (by 44%), which varied depending on experimental conditions, agricultural practices, and soil properties. In addition, eCO2 significantly increased soil water-filled pore space (by 6%), dissolved organic carbon content (by 11%), and nitrate nitrogen content (by 13%), but significantly reduced soil pH (by 1%). Moreover, eCO2 significantly increased soil microbial biomass carbon (by 28%) and soil microbial biomass nitrogen (by 7%) contents. Additionally, eCO2 significantly increased the abundances of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) amoA (by 21%), nirK (by 15%), and nirS (by 15%), but did not affect the abundances of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) amoA and nosZ.

However, it is still lack of a quantitative basis for predicting the functional stability of permafrost ecosystems in carbon (C) and nutrient cycling. We compiled the data of 708 observations from 89 air-warming experiments in the Northern Hemisphere and characterized the general effects of temperature increase on permafrost C exchange and balance, biomass production, microbial biomass, soil nutrients, and vegetation N dynamics through a meta-analysis. Also, an investigation was made on how responses might change with habitat-specific (e.g., plant functional groups and soil moisture status) conditions and warming variables (e.g., warming phases, levels, and timing). The net ecosystem C exchange (NEE) was found to be downregulated by warming as a result of a stronger sensitivity to warming in respiration (15.6%) than in photosynthesis (6.2%). Vegetation usually responded to warming by investing more C to the belowground, as belowground biomass increased much more (30.1%) than aboveground biomass (2.9%). Warming had a minor effect on microbial biomass. Warming increased soil ammonium and nitrate concentrations. What's more, a synthesis of 70 observations from 11 herbs and 9 shrubs revealed a 2.5% decline of N in green leaves. Compared with herbs, shrubs had a stronger response to respiration and had a decline in green leaf N to a greater extent. Not only in dry condition did green leaf N decline with warming but also in wet conditions. Warming in nongrowing seasons would negatively affect soil water, C uptake, and biomass production during growing seasons. Permafrost C loss and vegetation N decline may increase with warming levels and timing. Overall, these findings suggest that besides a positive C cycling-climate feedback, there will be a negative feedback between permafrost nutrient cycling and climate warming.","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8271' target='_blank'>10.1002/ece3.8271</a>",,"What are the effects of temperature increase on permafrost Carbon exchange and balance, biomass production, microbial biomass, soil nutrients, and vegetation Nitrogen dynamics?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

The results showed that experimental warming prolonged the flowering season by 2.08% across all species included in this study. In addition, flowering season responses were dependent on plant functional types, with a significant extension in herbaceous species (+2.18%) but no change in woody species. The warming impacts on the flowering season of wind-pollinated (-4.53%) and insect-pollinated species (+4.21%) were opposite. Among herbaceous species, the flowering seasons of forb (+4.47%) and specifically legume species (+15.06%) were positive, whereas grass species (-4.53%) showed negative responses to experimental warming. Moreover, experimental warming effects on the flowering season showed quadratic relationships with the latitude and the mean annual temperature but did not change with the mean annual precipitation. The responses of the flowering season to experimental warming also differed in terms of the warming magnitude.

Here we synthesize 88 published studies to show a phenological mismatch between above- and belowground plant responses to climate warming. For herbaceous plants, warming advanced both the start and end of aboveground growing season, resulting in an unchanged growing season length. In contrast, belowground phenophases (the start, end and length of the growing season) of herbaceous plants remained unchanged. For woody plants, climate warming did not affect any aboveground phenophases but extended their belowground growing season. Mismatches between above- and belowground phenology will strongly influence biomass allocation in plants, implying that terrestrial carbon cycling models based exclusively on aboveground responses are inaccurate.

In response, they are developing climate action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones, relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty, supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors: support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines. More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed. Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in national planning policies.

Carbon farming provides useful benefits for soil health, biomass production, and crop resilience, but the effects of different soil C sequestration approaches on the nitrogen (N) cycle remain controversial. While some C farming practices have been shown to reduce N fertilizer use in some cases, C farming could also impose an unwanted 'N penalty' through which soil C gains can only be maintained with additional N inputs, thereby increasing N losses to the environment. We systematically reviewed meta-analysis studies on the impacts of C farming on N cycling in agroecosystems and estimated the cumulative effect of several C farming practices on N cycling. We found that, on average, combined C farming practices significantly reduced nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching from soils, thus inferring both N cycling and climate change benefits. In addition to more widely studied C farming practices that generate organic C, we also discuss silicate rock additions, which offer a pathway to inorganic C sequestration that does not require additional N inputs, framing important questions for future research.

However, it may lead to an increase in the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) and leaching of nitrate (NO3-) to groundwater due to higher nitrogen (N) availability after crop residue incorporation. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis based on 345 observations from 90 peer-reviewed studies to evaluate the effects of crop residue return on soil N2O emissions and NO3- leaching for different locations, climatic and soil conditions, and agricultural management strategies. On average, crop residue incorporation significantly stimulated N2O emissions by 29.7%, but decreased NO3- leaching by 14.4%. The increase in N2O emissions was negatively and significantly correlated with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, and with the most significant changes occurring in the temperate climate zone. Crop residues stimulated N2O emission mainly in soils with pH ranging between 5.5 and 6.5, or above 7.5 in soils with low clay content. In addition, crop residue application decreased NO3- leaching significantly in soils with sandy loam, silty clay loam, and silt loam textures. Our analysis reveals that an appropriate crop residue management adapted to the site-specific soil and environmental conditions is critical for increasing soil organic carbon stocks and decreasing nitrogen losses. The most important novel finding is that residue return, despite stimulation of N2O emissions, is particularly effective in reducing NO3- leaching in soils with loamy texture, which are generally among the most productive arable soils.

A meta-analysis of a global dataset including 3,399 observations from 283 papers published from 1980s to February 2021 was conducted with the aim of elucidating N-mediated responses of tree biomass production to eCO(2) and the underlying mechanisms. We found that eCO(2) stimulated tree biomass production (+32.0%), while it induced accumulation of non-structural carbohydrates in leaves rather than in woods and roots, suggesting that the production may be C-limited but depend on the sink strength of organs. Biomass responses to eCO(2) of N-fertilized trees (+39.6%) were 68.4% greater than those of non-fertilized trees (+23.5%), confirming that tree growth is also N-limited. Such N limitation was alleviated by the eCO(2)-induced increases in N uptake and N-use efficiency (NUE), with the former being more important. Increases in tree N pool arose from the enhanced production of fine roots with a lower specific root length, whereas increases in NUE resulted from the flexibility in tissue C:N ratios instead of N resorption efficiency. The positive responses of tree biomass production to eCO(2) were greater for ectomycorrhizal trees and conifers than for arbuscular mycorrhizal trees and angiosperms, respectively. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that eCO(2) stimulates tree biomass production by increasing C availability, and alleviating N limitation in a feedback way via enhancing N uptake and NUE, and they improve our mechanistic understanding of responses of forest productivity and C sequestration to eCO(2) under global change.

Nevertheless, the aim of increasing of SOC encounters limitations, e.g. with regards to permanence of carbon storage or leakage effects in food production. Agmforestry systems (AFS) are a promising land use option that is able to sequester substantial amounts of SOC while addressing these challenges. With a focus on temperate climate zones worldwide, available information on SOC in AFS was reviewed to determine their SOC sequestration potential and respective controlling factors. From a total of 61 observations, SOC sequestration rates in soils of AFS were derived for alley cropping systems (n = 25), hedgerows (n = 26) and silvopastoral systems (n = 10). The results showed that AFS have a potential for substantial SOC sequestration in temperate climates. SOC stocks were higher in the topsoil (0-20 cm) than in the control in more than 70% of the observations, and higher within the subsoil (20-40 cm) for 81% of all observations, albeit large variation in the data. The mean SOC sequestration rates were slightly higher at 0-20 cm (0.21 +/- 0.79 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) compared to 20-40 cm soil depth (0.15 +/- 0.26 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). Hedgerows revealed highest SOC sequestration rates in topsoils and subsoils (0.32 +/- 0.26 and 0.28 +/- 0.15 t ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively), followed by alley cropping systems (0.26 +/- 1.15 and 0.23 +/- 0.25 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) and silvopastoral systems showing a slight mean SOC loss (-0.17 +/- 0.50 and -0.03 +/- 0.26 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). Moreover, SOC sequestration rates tended to be higher for AFS with broadleaf tree species compared to coniferous species.

The Arctic is also the most rapidly warming global area, with winter warming dominating. This warming is expected to have dramatic effects on tundra carbon and nutrient dynamics. We completed a meta-analysis of 166 experimental warming study papers to evaluate the hypotheses that warming changes tundra biogeochemical cycles in a habitat- and seasonally specific manner and that the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycles will be differentially accelerated, leading to decoupling of elemental cycles. We found that nutrient availability and plant leaf stoichiometry responses to experimental warming were variable and overall weak, but that both gross primary productivity and the plant C pool tended to increase with growing season warming. The effects of winter warming on C fluxes did not extend into the growing season. Overall, although warming led to more consistent increases in C fluxes compared to N or P fluxes, evidence for decoupling of biogeochemical cycles is weak and any effect appears limited to heath habitats. However, data on many habitats are too sparse to be able to generalize how warming might decouple biogeochemical cycles, and too few year-round warming studies exist to ascertain whether the season under which warming occurs alters how ecosystems respond to warming.

The present study aimed to examine the responses of SOC stocks to grass coverage at a soil depth of 0-30 cm in orchards compared to clean tillage. A total of 342 observations across China from 139 peer-reviewed publications were subjected to meta-analysis. Aggregated boosted tree analysis was performed, evaluating the determinants of SOC stocks, such as plant traits (e.g., fruit tree type, grass type, orchard age, and grass age), edaphic variables (e.g., initial SOC and nitrogen concentration, soil pH, and soil clay content), climatic factors (e.g., mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT)), and management practices (e.g., grass source, grass growing mode, fertilization, grass mowing, placement of mowed residues, and irrigation). On average, orchard grass coverage significantly enhanced SOC stocks by 21.47% (percentage change) compared to clean tillage. Biotic and abiotic factors influenced this increase in SOC stocks following grass coverage in orchards to different extents. Grass age and soil clay content were the main determinants driving the variation in the SOC stocks following grass coverage in orchards. Thus, we propose an efficient way to optimize C sequestration in grass covered orchards, regarding plant traits, climatic factors, edaphic variables, and management practices. Longer than 12 months of surface grass coverage with cultivated grass species in mature deciduous fruit orchards (>= 5 years) efficiently increased SOC stocks.

However, no consensus has yet emerged regarding the effects of fire disturbances on tropical biogeochemical cycles. Location Tropics. Time period 1960-2018. Major taxa studied Tropical ecosystems: Above- and below-ground carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics. Methods We analysed the impacts of fire on C and N dynamics in tropical ecosystems through a meta-analysis of 1,420 observations from 87 studies. Results Fire reduced both above- and below-ground C and N pools, with greater reductions above- than below-ground. Fire decreased soil total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-) and increased ammonium nitrogen (NH4+) in surface mineral soil layers but did not affect those in deep layers. Fire decreased TC and TN in savanna but did not affect those in tropical dry and moist forests. Fire did not affect NH4+ and NO3- in savanna because of non-significant responses of N mineralization rate (N-min) to fire. Conversely, fire increased NH4+ and decreased NO3- in tropical dry forest, but did not affect NH4+ and increased NO3- in tropical moist forest owing to thermal decomposition of soil organic N and increased soil nitrification, respectively. Moreover, NH4+ declined and NO3- increased initially and then decreased with time after fire. Above- and below-ground response variables to prescribed fire were mediated largely by fire frequency and experimental duration, respectively. Main conclusions Our results suggest a high vulnerability of the above-ground C and N pools to fire, whereas the biogeochemical cycles below-ground are of high complexity. Fire effects on below-ground C and N pools, which are highly uncertain and vegetation specific, should be investigated further.","GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.13422' target='_blank'>10.1111/geb.13422</a>",,"What are the impacts of fire on Carbon and Nitrogen dynamics in tropical ecosystems?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"

Coralline algae are comprised of high magnesium calcite and have long been considered one of the most susceptible taxa to the negative impacts of OA. We summarize these impacts and explore the causes of variability in coralline algal responses using a review/qualitative assessment of all relevant literature, meta-analysis, quantitative assessment of critical responses, and a discussion of physiological mechanisms and directions for future research. We find that most coralline algae experienced reduced abundance, calcification rates, recruitment rates, and declines in pH within the site of calcification in laboratory experiments simulating OA or at naturally elevated CO2 sites. There were no other consistent physiological responses of coralline algae to simulated OA (e.g., photo-physiology, mineralogy, and survival). Calcification/growth was the most frequently measured parameters in coralline algal OA research, and our meta-analyses revealed greater declines in seawater pH were associated with significant decreases in calcification in adults and similar but nonsignificant trends for juveniles. Adults from the family Mesophyllumaceae also tended to be more robust to OA, though there was insufficient data to test similar trends for juveniles. OA was the dominant driver in the majority of laboratory experiments where other local or global drivers were assessed. The interaction between OA and any other single driver was often additive, though factors that changed pH at the surface of coralline algae (light, water motion, epiphytes) acted antagonistically or synergistically with OA more than any other drivers.

Ozone layer depletion allows penetration of ultraviolet radiations, which are hazardous to human health. Climate change culminates in reduced food productivity. Limited empirical studies have been conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to quantify and understand the dynamics of soil N2O fluxes from smallholder cropping systems. The available literature on soil N2O fluxes in SSA is limited; hence, there is a pressing need to consolidate it to ease mitigation targeting and policy formulation initiatives. We reviewed the state of N2O emissions from selected cropping systems, drivers that significantly influence N2O emissions, and probable soil N2O emissions mitigation options from 30 studies in SSA cropping systems have been elucidated here. The review outcome indicates that coffee, tea, maize, and vegetables emit N2O ranging from 1 to 1.9, 0.4 to 3.9, 0.1 to 4.26, and 48 to 113.4 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The yield-scaled and N2O emissions factors ranged between 0.08 and 67 g N2O-N kg(-1) and 0.01 and 4.1%, respectively, across cropping systems. Soil characteristics, farm management practices, and climatic and environmental conditions were significant drivers influencing N2O emissions across SSA cropping systems. We found that site-specific soil N2O emissions mitigation measures are required due to high variations in N2O drivers across SSA. We conclude that appropriate fertilizer and organic input management combined with improved soil management practices are potential approaches in N2O emissions mitigation in SSA. We recommend that (i) while formulating soil N2O emissions mitigation approaches, in SSA, policymakers should consider site-specific targeting approaches, and (ii) more empirical studies need to be conducted in diverse agroecological zones of SSA to qualify various mitigation options on N2O emissions, yield-scaled N2O emissions, and N2O emission factors which are essential in improving national and regional GHG inventories.","ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURE","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/4800527' target='_blank'>10.1155/2021/4800527</a>","SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ZEA-MAYS L.; N2O EMISSIONS; AGRICULTURAL SOILS; MAIZE; FLUXES; CLIMATE; ECOSYSTEMS; CROPLANDS","What are the effects of smallholder cropping systems on nitrous oxide emissions in Sub-saharan Africa?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,"Evidence Review"

However, the magnitude and direction of soil CH4 uptake and emission rates in response to N addition on a global scale are still unclear. Here, to investigate the effects of N addition on soil CH4 uptake and emission rates in various upland and wetland ecosystems, we synthesized a large dataset comprising 878 paired observations from 178 studies. Across these studies, we found that N addition significantly reduced soil CH4 uptake rate in upland ecosystems but significantly increased soil CH4 emission rate in wetland ecosystems. The magnitude of the effects was ecosystem-type dependent. Following N addition, reduction of soil CH4 uptake rate and increase in CH4 emission rate were significantly higher in natural ecosystems (with the exception of grassland ecosystems) than in agricultural ecosystems. However, reduction in soil CH4 uptake rate increased with N addition rate in only natural ecosystems. Moreover, the soil CH4 uptake rate in N-limited ecosystems (cold temperate zone and Tibet Plateau) was less sensitive to N addition compared to N-rich ecosystems (subtropical and tropical zones). Additionally, organic N addition had a lower reduction effect on soil CH4 uptake in upland ecosystems and a lower stimulatory effect on soil CH4 emission rate in wetland ecosystems compared to the addition of inorganic N forms. Overall, our results shed light on the magnitude and direction of the effect of N addition on soil CH4 uptake and emission rates in diverse upland and wetland ecosystems and will help improve ecosystem models for predicting soil CH4 flux caused by N addition. © 2021","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108467' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108467</a>",,"What is the impact of nitrogen addition on soil methane in uplands and wetlands ?",3,1,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

However, no relevant review study is available for East Asian countries which are responsible for 70% of gaseous N losses from croplands globally. This review analyzed data of the biochar-induced N2O mitigation affected by experimental conditions, including experimental types, biochar types and application rates, soil properties, and chemical forms and application rates of N fertilizer for East Asian countries. The magnitude of biochar-induced N2O mitigation was evaluated by calculating N2O reduction index (Rindex, percentage reduction of N2O by biochar relative to control). The Rindex was further standardized against biochar application rate by calculating Rindex per unit of biochar application rate (ton ha−1) (Unit Rindex). The Rindex averaged across different experimental types (n = 196) was −21.1 ± 2.4%. Incubation and pot experiments showed greater Rindex than column and field experiments due to higher biochar application rate and shorter experiment duration. Feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature also affected Rindex; either bamboo feedstock or pyrolysis at &gt; 400 °C resulted in a greater Rindex. The magnitude of Rindex also increased with increasing biochar rate. Soil properties did not affect Rindex when evaluated across all experimental types, but there was an indication that biochar decreased N2O emission more at a lower soil moisture level in field experiments. The magnitude of Rindex increased with increasing N fertilizer rate up to 500–600 kg N ha−1, but it decreased thereafter. The Unit Rindex averaged across experimental types was −1.2 ± 0.9%, and it was rarely affected by experimental type and conditions but diminished with increasing biochar rate.

Although numerous individual studies had been conducted, the global patterns of the changes in SOC concentration following BSCs establishment remain unclear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of 184 independent observations at 47 sites to quantify the responses of SOC and other soil variables to BSCs establishment and identify the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that BSCs generally increased SOC by 70.9% compared to the controls (uncrusted soil), and the positive effects of BSCs on SOC in deserts (120.3%) were stronger than those in grasslands (32.7%). Mosses and lichens had a stronger positive effect on SOC than algae crusts (67.5%, 82.8%, and 58.2% respectively). Mixed crusts accumulated more SOC (181.6%) than single (moss, lichen and algae) crusts. The presence of BSCs considerably increased total nitrogen (TN) (+80.7%), total phosphorus (TP) (+20.3%), available N (+62.7%), and available P (+14.3%). Significant relationships were observed among the effect size of SOC and climate and soil N and P in both desert and grassland. The random forest analysis showed that TN could be considered as a determinant of the concentration of SOC, followed by climate (P < 0.01). Our study shows that the capacity of the BSCs to fix and store C could be regulated by soil N and P dynamics, indicating a major finding opening new ways to promote soil recovery and formation.

127044,"Impacts of Marine Heatwaves on Algal Structure and Carbon Sequestration in Conjunction With Ocean Warming and Acidification","Gao, G; Zhao, X; Jiang, MJ; Gao, L",2021,"As the ocean warms, the frequency, duration, intensity, and range of marine heatwaves (MHWs) increase. MHWs are becoming a severe challenge for marine ecosystems. However, our understanding in regard to their impacts on algal structure and carbon sequestration is still deficient or fragmentary, particularly when combined with ocean warming and acidification. In this paper, we reviewed the impacts of MHWs individually and combined with ocean warming and acidification on regime shift in algal community and carbon sequestration of both macroalgae and microalgae. Solid evidence shows that MHWs cause the decline of large canopy macroalgae and increase of turf-forming macroalgae in abundance, leading to the regime shift from kelp forests to seaweed turfs. Furthermore, increased grazing pressure on kelps due to tropicalization facilitates the expansion of turfs that prevent the recovery of kelps through plundering light and space. Meanwhile, MHWs could trigger microalgal blooms and the intensity of algal blooms is regulated by the severity of MHWs and nutrient availability. MHWs could lead to the decrease of carbon burial and sequestration by canopy-forming macroalgae due to depressed growth and increased mortality. The effects of MHWs on the productivity of microalgae are latitude-dependent: negative effects at low and mid-latitudes whilst positive effects at high latitudes. Ocean warming and acidification may accelerate the shift from kelps to turfs and thus decrease the carbon sequestration by canopy-forming macroalgae further. We propose that MHWs combined with ocean warming and acidification would reduce the biodiversity and facilitate the thriving of morphologically simple, ephemeral and opportunistic turfs and diatoms in coastal oceans, and phytoplankton with smaller size in open oceans. This structure shift would not be in favor of long-term carbon sequestration. Future studies could be conducted to test this hypothesis and investigate the impacts of MHWs on carbon sequestration under future ocean conditions.</p>","FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.758651' target='_blank'>10.3389/fmars.2021.758651</a>",,"What are the Impacts of Marine Heatwaves on Algal Structure and Carbon Sequestration in Conjunction With Ocean Warming and Acidification",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Evidence Review"

Rapid urbanization increases air temperature and creates an urban heat island (UHI) effect due to dwindling greenery. Thus, the UHI directly impacts the indoor and outdoor thermal comfort, air quality, and well-being of the city dwellers by affecting the microclimate. Further, the artificial cooling demand is increasing steeply in tropical cities, increasing carbon emissions. Therefore, researchers are currently focusing upon mitigation of the UHI effect and improving the urban microclimate. This review article deals with urban microclimate control using trees, grasses, shrubs, green walls, green roofs, and waterbodies. The contributory role of vegetation in regulating air temperature is reviewed comprehensively, and recommendations are made for ensuring the thermal comfort of urban residents. The effective use of vegetation in tropical cities can significantly improve the microclimate by reducing the air temperature up to 4 °C by green roofs, 9 °C by using trees, 12 °C by the vertical greening system. The rooftop greeneries with trees, shrubs, and turfs can reduce the building's overall cooling load by 20.01 %, 18.85 %, and 9.08 %, respectively. Implementing urban greeneries is essential to become sustainable cities and communities through a perfect blending of green landscape elements.

In this study, a meta-analysis compiling data from 150 studies was used to assess the effects of film mulching on SOC and soil GHG fluxes across different agricultural systems. In addition, the net global warming potentials (GWPs) of SOC, CH4 and N2O were calculated with the GWP approach. Plastic film mulching significantly promoted crop yield by 48.6%; did not affect SOC; reduced CH4 emissions from paddy fields by 64.2% and CH4 uptake in uplands by 16.1%; and increased soil N2O emissions by 23.9%. The effect of mulching on SOC and GHG fluxes varied among agricultural systems. Compared with the non-mulched field, the use of plastic film significantly increased SOC and decreased CH4 uptake in rainfed uplands but reduced SOC in irrigated uplands. In paddy fields, this practice significantly reduced the SOC stock and CH4 emissions but increased N2O emissions. Our results suggest that a low coverage ratio (&lt;50%), black film mulching and flat mulching effectively increase SOC levels compared to those in non-mulched fields, and a low coverage ratio, biodegradable film and ridge mulching could mitigate the positive effect of this practice on N2O emissions. Overall, our results suggest that plastic film mulching promotes crop productivity and slightly affects the net GWP in uplands.

In this study, we compiled published data on cumulative ammonia (NH3 ), nitrous oxide (N2 O) and methane (CH4 ) emissions from dairy slurry storage and evaluated the integrated effects of slurry pH, total solids (TS), ambient temperature (T) and length of storage (LOS) on emissions using linear mixed effects models. Results showed that the average nitrogen (N) loss by NH3 volatilization from slurry storage was 12.5% of total nitrogen (TN), while the loss by N2 O emissions only accounted for 0.05–0.39% of slurry TN. The NH3 –N losses were highly related to slurry pH, lowering slurry pH leading to significant decrease of emissions. Temperature also affected NH3 –N losses, with higher losses from slurry storage under warm conditions than cold conditions. No significant relationship was observed between NH3 –N losses and slurry TS contents within a range from 21–169 g kg−1 . The losses of N2 O–N from dairy slurry storage were less affected by slurry pH, TS contents and temperature. The carbon (C) loss as CH4 emissions varied from 0.01–17.2% of total carbon (TC). Emissions of CH4 –C presented a significant positive relationship with temperature, a negative relationship with slurry TS contents and no significant relationship with slurry pH ranging from 6.6–8.6. Length of storage (more than 30 days) had no significant influence on cumulative gas emissions from slurry storage.

However, uncertainties remain regarding the direction and magnitude of these effects, particularly in combination with changes in temperature and water availability. Location: Global. Time period: 1986–2020. Major taxa studied: Trees. Methods: We compiled 3,391 observations from 270 studies and performed a meta-analysis on: (1) the responses of Asat, gs and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) to eCO2, in addition to variations in these responses between species (phylogeny and leaf habit), within species (tree age) and within individuals (canopy position and leaf age); (2) the effects of changes in temperature and/or water availability on these responses; and (3) whether Asat and gs acclimatize to eCO2 in parallel. Results: We found that eCO2 stimulated Asat (β-factor =.68) and decreased gs (β-factor = −.36) and that iWUE increased in proportion to eCO2 (β-factor = 1.01), which conform with the theory of optimal stomatal behaviour. Meanwhile, conifers and older trees showed greater increases in Asat but less decreases in gs than angiosperms and young trees, respectively, with a proportional increase in iWUE being independent of phylogeny and tree age, which support the theory further. Warming had little effect on the responses of Asat and gs to eCO2, whereas drought amplified the Asat response but attenuated the gs response. However, Asat, rather than gs, acclimatized to eCO2, owing to nitrogen reduction, active investment of nitrogen and sink limitation. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that eCO2 can enhance carbon uptake and reduce water loss at the leaf scale, which may be modified by water stress.

However, the effects of these practices differ due to diverse climatic scenario, soil characteristics and management system. To identify the suitable practices that can be effective under tropical and subtropical conditions, a systematic evaluation in the form of a meta-analysis of these practices and their outcomes was performed over those regions. In this work we have included 516 observations from 84 articles published from 2000 to 2021 to analyse the influence of three CSA practices (conservation tillage, cover crop and biochar application) on the SOC (soil organic carbon) stocks over varying periods of experimentation. In addition to this, the combined effect of CSA and other conservation agronomic practices such as agroforestry has also been considered in the analysis. The results showed that biochar application had the most influence upon SOC stocks in the agricultural lands (25.38%) followed by conservation tillage (18.81%) and cover crop (15.8%).

To achieve the goal of limiting or mitigating these emissions, a rigorous abatement strategy with an additional focus on improving crop productivity is now imperative. Replacing traditional agriculture with soil conservation-based farming can have numerous ecological benefits. However, most assessments only consider improvements in soil properties and crop productivity, and often preclude the quantitative impact analysis on GHGs emissions. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate crop productivity (i.e., biomass, grain, total yield) and GHGs emissions (i.e., CO2, N2O, CH4) for three major soil conservation practices i.e., no-tillage, manures, and biochar. We also examined the yield potential of three major cereal crops (i.e., wheat, rice, maize) and their significance in mitigating GHGs emissions. None of the manures were able to reduce GHGs emissions, with poultry manure being the largest contributor to all GHGs emissions. However, pig-manure had the greatest impact on crop yield while emitting the least CO2 emissions. Use of biochar showed a strong coupling effect between reduction of GHGs (i.e., CH4 by -37%; N2O by -25%; CO2 by -5%) and the increase in crop productivity. In contrast, no-tillage resulted in higher GHGs emissions with only a marginal increase in grain yield. Depending on crop type, all cereal crops showed varied degrees of GHGs mitigation under biochar application, with wheat responding most strongly due to the additional yield increment. The addition of biochar significantly reduced CO2 and N2O emissions under both rainfed and irrigated conditions, although CH4 reductions were identical in both agroecosystems. Interestingly, the use of biochar resulted in a greater yield benefit in rainfed than in irrigated agriculture. Despite significant GHGs emissions, manure application contributed to higher crop yields, regardless of soil type or agroecosystem. Moreover, no-tillage showed a significant reduction in CH4 and N2O emissions under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Notably, biochar application in coarse while no-till in fine textured soils contributed to N2O mitigation. Most importantly, effectiveness of no-tillage as a countermeasure to GHGs emissions while providing yield benefits is inconsistent. Overall, the decision to use farm manures should be reconsidered due to higher GHGs emissions. We conclude that the use of biochar could be an ideal way to reduce GHGs emissions. However, further understanding of the underlying mechanisms and processes affecting GHGs emissions is needed to better understand the feedback effects in conservation agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Science of the Total Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150337' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150337</a>",,"What are the effects of soil conservation practices (no-tillage, manures, and biochar) on crop productivity (i.e., biomass, grain, total yield) and greenhouse gas emissions?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"

However, the extent and pattern of these climatic breakdowns are usally determined by the management practices in-place. The use of biochar on cropland soils holds a great promise for increasing the overall crop productivity. Nevertheless, biochar application to agricultural soils has grown in popularity as a strategy to off-set the negative feedback associated with agriculture GHGs emissions, i.e., CO2 (carbon dioxide), CH4 (methane), and N2O (nitrous oxide). Despite increasing efforts to uncover the potential of biochar to mitigate the farmland GHGs effects, there has been little synthesis of how different types of biochar affect GHGs fluxes from cropland soils under varied experimental conditions. Here, we presented a meta-analysis of the interactions between biochar and GHGs emissions across global cropland soils, with field experiments showing the strongest GHG mitigation potential, i.e. CO2 (RR = −0.108) and CH4 (RR = −0.399). The biochar pyrolysis temperature, feedstock, C: N ratio, and pH were also found to be important factors influencing GHGs emissions. A prominent reduction in N2O (RR = −0.13) and CH4 (RR = −1.035) emissions was observed in neutral soils (pH = 6.6–7.3), whereas acidic soils (pH ≤ 6.5) accounted for the strongest mitigation effect on CO2 compared to N2O and CH4 emissions. We also found that a biochar application rate of 30 t ha−1 was best for mitigating GHGs emissions while achieving optimal crop yield. According to our meta-analysis, maize crop receiving biochar amendment showed a significant mitigation potential for CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions. On the other hand, the use of biochar had shown significant impact on the global warming potential (GWP) of total GHGs emissions.

This review summarizes the properties and functions of biochar, and the effects of biochar on common GHGs (methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O)) and ammonia (NH3, an indirect GHG) during composting. Studies have shown that it is possible to improve the mitigation of GHG emissions during composting by adjusting the biochar amount, type of raw material, pyrolysis temperature, and particle size. Biochar produced from crop residues and woody biomass has a greater effect on mitigating CH4, N2O, and NH3 emissions during composting, and GHG emissions can be reduced significantly by adding about 10% (w/w) biochar. Biochar produced by high temperature pyrolysis (500–900 °C) has a greater effect on mitigating CH4 and N2O emissions, whereas biochar generated by low temperature pyrolysis (200–500 °C) is more effective at reducing NH3 emissions. Interestingly, adding granular biochar is more beneficial for mitigating CH4 emissions, whereas adding powdered biochar is better at reducing NH3 emissions. According to the current research status, developing new methods for producing and using biochar (e.g., modified or combined with other additives) should be the focus of future research into mitigating GHG emissions during composting.

However, the integrated effects on net greenhouse gas budget (NGHGB) and grain yield from different management practices remain poorly defined and vary with environmental and application conditions. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis on 347 observation sets of non-CO2 GHG (CH4 and N2O) emissions and grain yield, and 412 observations of soil organic carbon sequestration rate (SOCSR). Our results show that for paddy rice, replacing synthetic nitrogen at the rate of 30%-59% with organic fertilizer significantly decreased net GHG emissions (NGHGB: -15.3 +/- 3.4 [standard error], SOCSR: -15.8 +/- 3.8, non-CO2 GHGs: 0.6 +/- 0.1 in Mg CO2 eq ha(-1) year(-1)) and improved rice yield (0.4 +/- 0.1 in Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). In contrast, intermittent irrigation significantly increased net GHG emissions by 11.2 +/- 3.1 and decreased rice yield by 0.4 +/- 0.1. The reduction in SOC sequestration by intermittent irrigation (15.5 +/- 3.3), which was most severe (>20) in alkaline soils (pH > 7.5), completely offset the mitigation in CH4 emissions. Straw return for paddy rice also led to a net increase in GHG emissions (NGHGB: 4.8 +/- 1.4) in silt-loam soils, where CH4 emissions (6.3 +/- 1.3) were greatly stimulated. For upland cropping systems, mostly by enhancing SOC sequestration, straw return (NGHGB: -3.4 +/- 0.8, yield: -0.5 +/- 0.6) and no-tillage (NGHGB: -2.9 +/- 0.7, yield: -0.1 +/- 0.3) were more effective in warm climates.

Local farmers are willing to adopted rotary tillage (RT; harrowing to 10–15 cm depth) for easy management. However, the effects of these tillage management methods on agronomic productivity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, and economic return have not been quantified systematically, and their effectiveness remains in question. Here, we present a meta-analysis of the effects of these methods using 665 paired measurements from 144 peer-reviewed studies. The results indicated that DT significantly increased crop yields by 7.5% relative to RT, and even greater increases were observed in regions with low temperatures and with a wheat cropping system. In contrast, NT resulted in a yield reduction of 3.7% relative to RT, however, controlling for the appropriate temperature and long extension duration (&gt;15 yr) could reduce yield losses and even increase the yield. Both DT and NT significantly enhanced SOC sequestration relative to RT. Adoption of DT would lead to both higher total GHG emissions (N2O and CH4 ) and increased energy costs, while NT reduced GHG emissions.

The results showed that manipulating crop density, using an intermittent irrigation regime for paddy field rice, applying N as split applications or partially substituting inorganic fertilizer N with organic N sources could achieve reductions in AV and YSAV reduction of 10–20 %; adopting drip irrigation regimes, adding water surface barrier films to paddy fields, or using double inhibitor (urease and nitrification), slow-release or biofertilizers could achieve 20–40 % mitigation; plastic film mulching, applying fertilizer by irrigation or using controlled-release fertilizers could yield 40–60 % reduction; use of a urease inhibitor, fully substituting fertilizer N with organic N, or applying fertilizer by deep placement could decrease AV and YSAV by over 60 %. In addition, use of soil amendments, applying suitable inorganic N sources, or adopting crop rotation, intercropping or a rice-fish production model all had significant benefits to control AV.

Here, we conduct a broad meta-analysis of 90 papers to quantify the responses of CH4 uptake to N addition in upland soil. The results show that N addition has a significant negative impact on soil CH4 uptake (−19.25%), which is termed the N inhibition effect. Soil pH is identified as the dominant factor, with the other factors affecting the CH4 uptake through the alteration of soil pH. The N inhibition effect is observed to be large and significant in forest and grassland, but small and insignificant in farmland, because of the distinct composition of their methanotrophic communities. A threshold of the N addition level is identified at about 68 kg N ha−1 year−1, which indicates the lowest N inhibition effect. Furthermore, the convex relationship between response ratio of CH4 uptake (negative) and N addition duration indicates that a medium level of N addition duration has the largest N inhibition effect, and longer or shorter durations will both reduce the effect.

However, the differences in CH4 emissions across wetland types in these regions have not been well understood. We synthesized approximately 9000 static chamber CH4 measurements during the growing season from 83 sites across pan-Arctic regions. We highlighted spatial variations of CH4 emissions corresponding to environmental heterogeneity across wetland types. CH4 emission is the highest in fens, followed by marshes, bogs, and the lowest in swamps. This gradient is controlled by the water table, soil temperature, and dominant plant functional types and their interactions. The water table position for maximum CH4 emission is below, close to, and above the ground surface in bogs, marshes/fens, and swamps, respectively. The temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of CH4 emissions varied among different wetland types, ranging from the lowest in swamps to the highest in fens. The interactive impact of temperature and the water table positions on CH4 emissions are regulated with dominant plant functional types. CH4 emissions from wetlands dominated by vascular plants rely more on species composition than that dominated by non-vascular plants. Wetlands with greater abundance of graminoids (e.g., fens) have higher CH4 emissions than tree-dominated wetlands (e.g., swamps). This synthesis emphasizes the role of wetland heterogeneity in determining the strength of CH4 emissions.

Previous reviews found little or no soil organic C (SOC) accrual in NT soils as compared with full inversion tillage when soils are sampled deeper than 30 cm. Here, we present the results of a global meta-analysis of studies assessing SOC and total N (TN) storage and dynamics in NT and tilled soils from the most important agricultural regions of the world. Overall, our results show that NT soils stored 6.7 +/- 1.9 Mg C ha(-1) and 1.1 +/- 0.4 Mg N ha(-1) more than tilled soils (0-to-100-cm depth) with an average of 16 yr of NT, in contrast with previous findings. However, C sequestration (+4.7 +/- 1.9 Mg C ha(-1) in the 0-to-60-cm depth with an average of 11 yr of NT) depended on the association of NT with increased crop frequency and the inclusion of legumes cover crops. Single-cropping systems lack the necessary C inputs to offset SOC losses in the soil profile (below 30-cm depth). However, double-cropping systems decreased soil TN that may constrain future C sequestration. The use of legumes alleviated TN loss and supported soil C sequestration. Briefly, our findings indicate that NT can avoid SOC losses from tilled soils, partially offsetting CO2 emissions from agriculture. Moreover, NT with agricultural intensification can promote soil C sequestration, thus contributing to soil quality, food security, and adaptation to climate change.

Although numerous studies have been conducted to examine responses of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes to biochar or N addition, biochar is often co-applied with N fertilizer and the interactive effects of the two factors still remain unclear. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of manipulative experiments with 267 two-factor observations to quantify the main and interactive effects of biochar and N addition on soil GHG fluxes at a global scale. Our results showed that biochar addition significantly increased soil CO2 emission by 10.1%, but decreased N2O emission by 14.7%. Meanwhile, N addition increased both soil CO2 and N2O emissions by 11.6% and 288%, respectively. The combination of biochar and N addition also exhibited significant positive effect on CO2 (+18.0%) and N2O (+148%) emissions, but there were non-significant changes in CH4 fluxes. Consequently, antagonistic interaction between biochar and N addition was observed in soil GHG fluxes and their global warming potential (GWP), except for CH4 uptake showing an additive interaction. This synthesis highlights the importance of the interactive effects between biochar and N addition, providing a quantitative basis to develop sustainable strategies toward widespread application of biochar to preserve cropping system and mitigate climate change. © 2021 The Authors.

However, no systematic conclusions have been drawn yet because the environmental factors vary among various studies. A meta-analysis was carried out to evaluate the impact of plastic film mulching (PM) and straw mulching (SM) on grain yields and greenhouse gas emissions from two major cereal crops (maize and wheat) based on data from 61 peer-reviewed publications. The results showed that PM and SM, when averaged across all studies, significantly increased maize yield (13.3 % and 7.3 %, respectively) and wheat yield (12.5 % and 3.5 %, respectively) compared with no-mulching (NM). Generally, PM and SM significantly increased N2O emission by 18.6 % and by 24.7 % compared with NM, respectively. CO2 emission was significantly increased by PM and CH4 uptake was significantly inhibited by PM, while the increase in CO2 emission under SM was not significant but CH4 uptake was significantly promoted. The impact of soil mulching on crop yields and GHG emissions was also affected by temperature, water input amount, cultivation practice and nitrogen (N) application rate. Specifically, ridge-furrow cultivation with plastic film on the ridge was highly recommended for maize production, especially when mean seasonal air temperature was &lt;20℃ and water input was &lt;350 mm. Straw mulching was more suitable for maize production under high temperature (&gt;20℃) and water input (&gt;350 mm). The effect of SM on the increase in wheat yield under low water input (&lt;350 mm) and moderate temperature (&gt;10℃) was not significantly worse than that of PM. N2O and CO2 emissions under SM in the wheat field were not significantly increased compared to NM, while these emissions under PM were significantly increased when water input was &lt;350 mm and temperatue &gt;10℃. However, PM should be given more consideration in wheat production because its greater effect size on wheat yield and lower effect size on N2O emission relative to SM under most classifications, especially under partial mulching. These results have important implications for choosing proper mulching practices to increase crop yields while decreasing the adverse environmental effects in agricultural production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Field Crops Research","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108210' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108210</a>","Crops yields; Greenhouse gas emissions; Meta-analysis; Plastic film mulching; Straw mulching","What is the impact of plastic film and straw mulching on crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions in maize and wheat crops?",3,1,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

The objective of this study is to quantify the effects of various management practices on N2O and NO emissions and crop yields by performing a pairwise meta-analysis. We collected 39 peer-reviewed publications that recorded simultaneous measurements of N2O and NO emissions from various agroecosystems. Five management practices, namely reducing nitrogen (N) fertilizer input, application of enhanced efficiency fertilizers, biochar or aged organic materials (such as compost, animal wastes and oil cake), and drip irrigation, decreased both N2O (ranging from −24.9 % to −2.6 %) and NO (ranging from −48.1 % to −8.0 %) emissions. Reducing more than 25 % of the full N input is not recommended because of the significant loss of crop yields. Two management practices, namely returning crop residues and no-tillage, increased N2O emissions (ranging from 6.1 % to 12.9 %) and decreased NO emissions (ranging from −32.1 % to −21.2 %).

The establishment of hedgerows may be a promising strategy to promote carbon (C) sinks for climate change mitigation. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis compiling data from 83 sites on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks beneath hedgerows in comparison with adjacent croplands and grasslands, plus biomass data from 64 hedgerows. On average (± SD), the establishment of hedgerows on cropland increased SOC stocks by 32 ± 23 %. No significant differences were found between the SOC stocks of hedgerows and those of grassland. The average above-ground biomass stock was 47 ± 29 Mg C ha−1. Only one study reported measurements of below-ground biomass stocks and root/shoot ratios. Based on these measurements, an average below-ground biomass stock of 44 ± 28 Mg C ha−1 was estimated, but with high uncertainty. In total, hedgerows were estimated to store 104 ± 42 Mg ha−1 more C than croplands, with biomass contributing 84 % (87 ± 40 Mg C ha−1) and soil 16 % (17 ± 12 Mg C ha−1) to this amount. Total C sequestration with the establishment of hedgerows on cropland could be between 2.1 and 5.2 Mg ha−1 year−1 for a period of 50 and 20 years, respectively. Our results indicate that C stocks in hedgerows are on average comparable to estimates for forests. The establishment of hedgerows, especially on cropland, can therefore be an effective option for C sequestration in agricultural landscapes while enhancing biodiversity and soil protection. © 2021, The Author(s).","Regional Environmental Change","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-021-01798-8' target='_blank'>10.1007/s10113-021-01798-8</a>","Agroforestry; Carbon storage; Climate change mitigation; Climate-smart agriculture; Review; Soil organic matter","What is the impact of hedgerows on carbon sequestration in temperate climate zone soils?",3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

The production of these enzymes in soil is the most important biological strategy for acquiring phosphate ions from organic molecules. Previous works showed how soil potential phosphatase activity is mainly driven by climatic conditions and soil nitrogen (N) and carbon. Nonetheless, future trends of the activity of these enzymes under global change remain little known. We investigated the influence of some of the main drivers of change on soil phosphatase activity using a meta-analysis of results from 97 published studies. Our database included a compilation of N and P fertilization experiments, manipulation experiments with increased atmospheric CO2 concentration, warming, and drought, and studies comparing invaded and non-invaded ecosystems. Our results indicate that N fertilization leads to higher phosphatase activity, whereas P fertilization has the opposite effect. The rise of atmospheric CO2 levels or the arrival of invasive species also exhibits positive response ratios on the activity of soil phosphatases. However, the occurrence of recurrent drought episodes decreases the activity of soil phosphatases. Our analysis did not reveal statistically significant effects of warming on soil phosphatase activity. In general, soil enzymatic changes in the reviewed experiments depended on the initial nutrient and water status of the ecosystems. The observed patterns evidence that future soil phosphatase activity will not only depend on present-day soil conditions but also on potential compensations or amplifications among the different drivers of global change. The responses of soil phosphatases to the global change drivers reported in this study and the consideration of cost–benefit approaches based on the connection of the P and N cycle will be useful for a better estimation of phosphatase production in carbon (C)–N–P models. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15832' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.15832</a>","atmospheric CO2 increment experiment; drought; global change; invasive species; meta-analysis; N and P fertilization; phosphorus cycle; soil phosphatase activity","What are the effects of global change drivers on soil phosphatase activity?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,"Evidence Review"

This study reviews the current understanding of the effect of NIs use on N2O emissions from urine patches, including the factors that affect their efficacy, as well as the unintended consequences of NIs use. It brings together the fundamental aspects of targeted management of urine patches for reducing N2O emissions involving inhibitors. The available literature of 196 datasets indicates that dicyandiamide (DCD), 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), and 2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl) pyridine (nitrapyrin) reduced N2O emissions from urine patches by 44 ± 2%, 28 ± 38% and 28 ± 5%, (average ± s.e.), respectively. DCD also increased pasture dry matter and nitrogen (N) uptake by 13 ± 2% and 15 ± 3%, (average ± s.e.), respectively. The effect of DMPP and nitrapyrin on pasture dry matter and N uptake, assessed in only one study, was not significant. It also suggests that harmonizing the timing of inhibitor use with urine-N transformation increase the efficacy of NIs. No negative impacts on non-targeted soil and aquatic organisms have been reported with the recommended rate of DCD applied to urine and recommended applications of DMPP and nitrapyrin for treated mineral fertilisers and manures. However, there was evidence of the presence of small amounts of DCD residues in milk products as a result of its use on livestock grazed pasture. DMPP and nitrapyrin can also enter the food chain via grazing livestock. The study concludes that for the use of NIs in livestock grazed systems, research is needed to establish acceptable maximum residue level (MRL) of NIs in soil, plant, and animal products, and develop technologies that optimise physical mixing between NIs and urine patches. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Science of the Total Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148099' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148099</a>","Greenhouse gas mitigation; Livestock excreta; Nitrogen loss; Nutrient cycling; Pasture nitrogen uptake","What are the effects of nitrification inhibitors on nitrous oxide emissions from livestock urine patches?",3,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Although a growing number of studies have measured the runoff retention (RR) performance of GRs and investigated the underpinning factors, a systematic and quantitative understanding is lacking. This study applies a statistical approach on a dataset of 2375 original experimental samples associated with the RR performance of GRs observed across 21 countries, consolidated from 75 internationally peer-reviewed studies published in 2005-2020. The results show that the sampled RR rates (i.e., the proportion of rainfall retained on a per-event basis) range widely (0-100%), with an average of 62%. Rainfall intensity, substrate depth, GR surface coverage, climate type, vegetation type, and season type partially explain the variances in retention performance. Moreover, the effects of some factors (e.g., rainfall intensity) are not isolated but contingent on other factors (e.g., vegetative cover). This global synthesis shows few samples emanate from Africa, Central America, and Central Asia, highlighting the need of more GR research and applications in these regions. The average GR RR rate appears lower than some specified in green building standards, which implies the need to further improve the RR performance of GRs or combine GRs with other RR measures. Contingent effects of GR RR incluencing factors demonstrate the need to leverage design parameters and to account for local weather and climate characteristics in the optimization of GR performance.","Resources, Conservation and Recycling","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105577' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105577</a>",,"What is the effectiveness of different types of green roofs for stormwater runoff retention?",2,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,3,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Nature-based coastal protection is becoming a global strategy to enhance coastal resilience through the cost-effective creation, restoration and sustainable use of coastal wetlands. However, the resilience to sea-level rise of coastal wetlands created under Nature-based Solution has been assessed largely on a regional scale. Here we assess, using a meta-analysis, the difference in accretion, elevation, and sediment deposition rates between natural and restored coastal wetlands across the world. Our results show that restored coastal wetlands can trap more sediment and that the effectiveness of these restoration projects is primarily driven by sediment availability, not by wetland elevation, tidal range, local rates of sea-level rise, and significant wave height. Our results suggest that Nature-based Solutions can mitigate coastal wetland vulnerability to sea-level rise, but are effective only in coastal locations where abundant sediment supply is available. Coastal wetlands restored by Nature-based Solutions can trap more sediments than natural ones, and their efficiency is mainly determined by sediment supply, according to a meta-analysis of studies globally.

However, inconsistent results have been obtained with regard to major crops such as rice and wheat in rice–wheat rotation systems of China. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive meta-analysis of literature data. The yield response to warming differed for rice and wheat in the rice–wheat rotation system. Overall, warming significantly increased wheat yield (by 4.8%) but significantly reduced rice yield (by 14.8%). A number of factors were responsible for these observations. For example, rice yield responses varied with the temperature increase, variety and nitrogen (N) rate. Of these, N was the most important variable influencing yield responses to warming. The yield loss for rice was lower at temperature increases of 0.40–1.40°C and at a high N rate than that at temperature increases of 1.60–2.49°C and at a low N rate, respectively. The yield loss of indica rice was lower than that of japonica rice. For wheat, however, yield responses to warming varied with the warming regime, ambient temperature, temperature increases, and CO2 concentrations. Of these factors, ambient temperature was the most important variable influencing yield in response to warming. Warming increased wheat yield at a mean growth season temperature ≤10°C, temperature increases of 0.80–1.50°C, and at ambient CO2 concentrations. In addition, either daytime warming or nighttime warming significantly increased wheat yield. However, all-day warming had no effect on wheat yields.

F.; Jiang, J.",2021,"The increase of fossil-fuel burning and nitrogen (N) fertilizer consumption continues to elevate global N deposition, leading to significant increases of soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations, and thus N2O emissions. This is especially important for natural, unmanaged soils which are considered as areas that are sensitive to N input. However, uncertainties exist regarding the interactions of soil N2O emissions with soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations in response to N input in different climatic regions, as well as their underlying potential mechanisms. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the responses of these three forms of N to external N input across global natural ecosystems, using data extracted from peer-reviewed studies. The results show that soil NO3- concentrations are increased to a much larger extent by N input in temperate regions (136%) compared to tropical (62%) and subtropical (54%) regions, whereas the increase of soil NH4+ concentrations by N input is much less than soil NO3- concentrations, at 20%, 26% and 28% in temperate, tropical and subtropical regions, respectively. The significantly larger increase in soil NO3- concentrations but slightly lower increase in soil NH4+ concentrations in temperate regions compared to other climatic zones may be ascribed to the dominant nitrification process in temperate areas, which promotes the conversion of NH4+ to NO3-. Soil N2O emissions were increased to the greatest extent in subtropical regions (348%) in response to N input, followed by temperate regions (111%) and tropical regions (44%), which may be a result of the dominant denitrification process in subtropical regions, which promotes N2O production. It is likely that denitrification also dominates N2O production in tropical regions, but the dampened effect of N input on stimulating soil N2O emissions in these areas suggests that the loss of NO3- substrate due to intensive leaching might be an important issue. This study could provide a better understanding of the heterogeneous risks of soil N responses in different climatic zones in the context of increasing global N deposition.","European Journal of Soil Science","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13131' target='_blank'>10.1111/ejss.13131</a>",,"What are the effects of nitrogen input on soil nitrous oxide emissions and soil ammonia and nitrate concentrations in natural ecosystems?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

However, the driving mechanism by which soil labile carbon and nitrogen affect greenhouse gas emissions from wetland ecosystems under global nitrogen input is not well understood. Working out the driving factor of nitrogen input on greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands is critical to reducing global warming from nitrogen input. Thus, we synthesized 72 published studies (2144 paired observations) of greenhouse gas fluxes and soil labile compounds of carbon and nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, soil microbial biomass nitrogen and carbon), to understand the effects of labile carbon and nitrogen on greenhouse gas emissions under global nitrogen input. Across the data set, nitrogen input significantly promoted carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from wetlands. In particular, at lower nitrogen rates (<100 kg ha(-1).yr(-1)) and with added ammonium compounds, freshwater wetland significantly promoted carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Peatland was the largest nitrous oxide source under these conditions. This meta-analysis also revealed that nitrogen input stimulated dissolved organic carbon, ammonium, nitrate, microbial biomass carbon and microbial biomass nitrogen accumulation in the wetland ecosystem. The variation-partitioning analysis and structural equation model were used to analyze the relationship between the greenhouse gas and labile carbon and nitrogen further. These results revealed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the primary factor driving greenhouse gas emission from wetlands under global nitrogen input, whereas microbial biomass carbon (MBC) more directly affects greenhouse gas emission than other labile carbon and nitrogen.

However, the efficacy of RF on crop yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) remains uncertain under different climate and management conditions. Here, we compiled data from 48 publications to evaluate the response of yield and SOC to RF in China. Overall, our meta-analysis showed that RF increased yield by 30.2%, but it had no effects on SOC. When differentiated based on different categories, yield and SOC varied by crop species, climate, soil textures, mulching management, and ridge–furrow patterns. RF increased the yield of wheat, maize, soybean, rape, linseed, potato, and SOC under soybean cultivation. Yield increase with RF was also consistent across temperature and precipitation. Yield increase was observed in all the soil textures. There were no RF effects on SOC under different soil textures. RF enhanced yields under no mulching, straw mulching and plastic film mulching, but increased SOC only in combination with straw mulching. A higher yield increase was observed under alternating small and large ridges (ASLR) than alternating ridges and furrows (AR). RF decreased SOC by 11.7% under AR, but had no effects on SOC under ASLR.

While most studies have focused on the effects of no-till on nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide fluxes, much less attention has been paid to the impacts on methane (CH4) emissions. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether tillage management (conventional till, CT vs. NT) affects soil CH4 fluxes, and what management and environmental conditions regulate the effect. The regulating factors we identified include crop, climatic zone, soil class and experiment age (i.e. years since beginning NT). Our study included 41 papers, with a total number of 90 case studies, that covered arable lands of all five continents. On average, NT significantly decreased CH4 emissions from paddy fields, from 12.39 to 9.55 mg m−2 h-1 (p &lt; 0.05). Conversely, NT showed a slight but non-significant tendency to increase CH4 emissions in maize-cultivated fields, from an average of -0.15 mg m−2 h-1 of CT to 0.05 mg m−2 h-1 of NT. Other factors moderating the NT effect – like climate, soil, or years since the conversion to NT management – had weak regulation on soil CH4 emissions, with the exception for a slight tendency (not significant) of NT to reduce emissions in humid subtropical climate, with average CH4 fluxes of 3.90 mg m−2 h-1 vs. 5.01 mg m−2 h-1 of CT. However, we found that the effect of climate is often confounded by choice of crop, and thus should be interpreted with caution. While NT is used for many other soil benefits, our results indicate that the effect on CH4 emissions in dryland crops is nonexistent or weak in the investigated literature. However, considerable CH4 emission reduction is possible for rice production or other production systems that use flooded soils. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Soil and Tillage Research","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.105042' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.still.2021.105042</a>",,"What are the effects of no tillage on agricultural soil methane fluxes?",3,1,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,3,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"
126848,"How does soil compaction alter nitrous oxide fluxes? A meta-analysis","Hernandez-Ramirez, G.; Ruser, R.; Kim, D.-G.",2021,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and precursor of ozone layer depletion. Managed terrestrial ecosystems are major anthropogenic sources of N2O, primarily generated in the soil. The physical makeup of the soil interplays with the underlying biochemistry that produces N2O. Therefore, it has been conceptualized that either compacting or loosening the soil will alter N2O emissions; however, a unified framework of these relationships is yet to be established. Here, we compiled, reviewed and analyzed available field studies that have evaluated how applied compaction or alleviation of compacted soils impacts N2O emissions. Of the 108 available pairwise comparisons, 82 % of the cases showed detrimental increases in N2O emissions caused by increased compaction. Overall, N2O emissions nearly doubled because of soil compaction effects (P &lt; 0.05). This doubling of N2O emissions was linked to a relative reduction of 9 % in soil porosity (i.e., 0.05 cm3 cm−3) caused by applied compaction. This linkage to soil porosity was clearly evident in both croplands and pastures. Across the managed terrestrial ecosystems evaluated, the strongest relative effects of compaction on N2O emissions were found in forest and pasture soils. Overall, N2O emissions in forest soils showed a fivefold increase caused by compaction (P &lt; 0.05; n = 11). This massive response in forest soils can be attributed to: i) their low N2O emission baseline; ii) their acidic pH, which intrinsically favors N2O emissions; iii) having some of the heaviest traffic loads found across our meta-analysis (e.g., 16 Mg); and iv) an increase in soil microporosity. Pasture soils also displayed substantial compaction effects on N2O emissions, with a threefold increase (P &lt; 0.05; n = 25). This was explained in part by the elevated nitrogen input rates in pastures (e.g., 600–1000 kg N ha-1). Conversely, alleviation of soil compaction by implementing controlled traffic farming (CTF) in vegetable and grain croplands reduced N2O emissions consistently in all available pairwise comparisons (P &lt; 0.05; n = 19). At the field scale, CTF greatly decreased N2O emissions by one-third compared with farmlands managed with conventional random traffic (4.48 versus 2.86 kg N2O-N ha-1). However, after reviewing the available literature, we witnessed a paucity of information about how long it takes for soils to self-alleviate from the detrimental effects of compaction on N2O emissions. Additionally, insights gained through meta-analysis revealed the interplay of soil compaction with underlying heavy textures, acidic pH, and reduced porosities, which collectively exacerbate N2O emissions. Nevertheless, these complex interactions operate differentially across contrasting land use options. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Soil and Tillage Research","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.105036' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.still.2021.105036</a>",,"What is the impact of applied compaction or alleviation of compacted soils on nitrous oxide emissions?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

These disparities have resulted in difficulties predicting future phenological shifts, detecting phenological mismatches and identifying other ecological consequences. Experimental warming studies are uniquely poised to help us understand how climate warming will impact plant phenology, and meta-analyses allow us to expose broader trends from individual studies. Here, we review 70 studies comprised 1226 observations of plant phenology under experimental warming. We find that plants are advancing their early-season phenophases (bud break, leaf-out, and flowering) in response to warming while marginally delaying their late-season phenophases (leaf coloration, leaf fall, and senescence). We find consistency in the magnitude of phenological shifts across latitude, elevation, and habitat types, whereas the effect of warming on nonnative annual plants is two times larger than the effect of warming on native perennial plants. Encouragingly for researchers, plant phenological responses were generally consistent across a variety of experimental warming methods. However, we found numerous gaps in the experimental warming literature, limiting our ability to predict the effects of warming on phenological shifts. In particular, studies outside of temperate ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere, or those that focused on late-season phenophases, annual plants, nonnative plants, or woody plants and grasses, were underrepresented in our data set. Future experimental warming studies could further refine our understanding of phenological responses to warming by setting up experiments outside of traditionally studied biogeographic zones and measuring multiple plant phenophases (especially late-season phenophases) across species of varying origin, growth form, and life cycle. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15685' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.15685</a>","climate change; experimental warming; meta-analysis; phenological sensitivity; phenology; warming","What are the impacts of experimental climate warming on plant phenology?",3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Although previous meta-analyses proved that grazing exclusion improved soil carbon (C) storage of grasslands in China, we know little about its effect on grassland ecosystems elsewhere and whether litter accumulation induced by grazing exclusion regulates soil C storage. Using meta-analysis, we integrated 91 publications to examine the effects of grazing exclusion on community litter and soil C storage, accompanied by analysis of the regulating roles of body size of herbivore, climatic conditions, and grazing exclusion duration. We found that grazing exclusion enhanced litter biomass and decomposition rate but did not change litter chemical quality. Generally, grazing exclusion enhanced plant production and soil C storage across grassland worldwide. Exclusion of medium and small herbivores had stronger effects on aboveground litter production and soil C storage than exclusion of large herbivores, and grazing exclusion's enhancement on litter production and soil C storage tended to increase as grazing exclusion proceeded. Notably, grazing exclusion-induced increase in aboveground litter biomass was attributed to the increase in biomass of graminoids, while root biomass, not aboveground litter biomass, primarily regulated the increase in soil C storage. The stimulating effect of grazing exclusion on soil C storage was enhanced possibly due to enhanced root biomass response along a precipitation gradient. Generally, our study provided new insights that management practice under grazing exclusion should take plant community dynamics, grazing exclusion duration, preceding grazer type, and climate conditions into account simultaneously. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Land Degradation and Development","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4008' target='_blank'>10.1002/ldr.4008</a>",,"What are the effects of grazing exclusion on community litter and soil Carbon storage in grassland ecosystems?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

The effects of continuous increase in elevated CO2 (EC) and elevated temperature (ET) on N2O emissions are not fully known. We synthesized 209 measurements from 70 published studies and carried out a meta-analysis to examine individual and interactive effects of EC and ET on N2O emissions from grasslands, croplands and forests. On average, a significant increase of 23% in N2O emissions was observed under EC across all case studies. EC did not affect N2O emissions from grasslands or forests, but significantly increased N2O emissions in croplands by 38%. The extent of ET effects on N2O emissions was nonsignificant and there was no significant difference in N2O emission responses among these three terrestrial systems. ET only promoted N2O emissions in forest by about 32% when ET was less than 2°C. The interactive effect of EC and ET on N2O emissions was significantly synergistic, showing a greater increase than the sum of the effects caused by EC and ET alone.

L.",2021,"We employed a systematic evidence review to evaluate empirical scientific evidence for the effectiveness of buffering headwater (typically non-fish-bearing) streams to maintain stream temperature and stream-associated amphibian populations in the Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States. To address our synthesis objective, we identified thirteen temperature, seven amphibian, and two temperature/amphibian primary research studies that met objective inclusion criteria. We evaluated external validity for how study treatments inform or were linked to causal factors influencing temperature response (a) and how the sampled population represented or provided inference to an intended target population or landscape (b). The evidence indicated substantial variability in the temperature response to streamside buffers. The effect size for the mean 7-day maximum temperature metric showed a positive association when comparing no-buffers (clearcut) to treatments with wide buffers (≥ 30 m). However, this effect varied substantially and overlap existed in effect sizes among no-cut buffers, no-cut plus variable retention buffers, and no-cut patch buffers all ≤ 20 m wide. Large variability in effect size among treatments obscured any potential trend between effect size for the seasonal (summer) mean daily maximum temperature metric and buffer width. Shade was correlated with temperature response within several studies, but direct comparisons of treatment effectiveness among studies as a function of shade was confounded by different measurement methods. The evidence also indicated that variation in temperature response among studies may be associated with multiple factors (geology, hydrology, topography, latitude, and stream azimuth) that influence thermal sensitivity of streams to shade loss. For amphibians, we found mixed evidence for relationships between population responses and buffers maintained along streams after forest harvest. Specifically, we did not find evidence to support the contention that positive population responses are associated consistently with larger buffers. Also, considerable uncertainty exists about which environmental covariates reliably explain variation in amphibian population responses. Collectively, our results indicate that evidence is weak to address questions most relevant to policy discussions concerning effectiveness of alternative riparian management schemes. Future studies should test effectiveness of alternative treatments with either experimental or purposefully structured observational studies to develop tools and derive guidelines for how to achieve management goals based on site and landscape characteristics.","Forest Ecology and Management","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119190' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119190</a>",,"What is the effect of riparian buffers on stream temperature and stream-associated amphibian populations in the Pacific Northwest of Canada and the United States?",3,1,3,3,2,1,1,3,1,3,3,1,2,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

P.; Lesic, V.; Lemic, D.",2021,"Simple Summary Climate change and extreme weather events have a major impact on crop production and agricultural pests. As generally adaptable organisms, insect pests respond differently to different causes of climate change. In this review, we address the effects of rising temperatures and atmospheric CO2 levels, as well as changing precipitation patterns, on agricultural insect pests. Since temperature is the most important environmental factor affecting insect population dynamics, it is expected that global climate warming could trigger an expansion of their geographic range, increased overwintering survival, increased number of generations, increased risk of invasive insect species and insect-transmitted plant diseases, as well as changes in their interaction with host plants and natural enemies. As climate change exacerbates the pest problem, there is a great need for future pest management strategies. These include monitoring climate and pest populations, modified integrated pest management strategies, and the use of modelling prediction tools which are presented here. Climate change and global warming are of great concern to agriculture worldwide and are among the most discussed issues in today's society. Climate parameters such as increased temperatures, rising atmospheric CO2 levels, and changing precipitation patterns have significant impacts on agricultural production and on agricultural insect pests. Changes in climate can affect insect pests in several ways. They can result in an expansion of their geographic distribution, increased survival during overwintering, increased number of generations, altered synchrony between plants and pests, altered interspecific interaction, increased risk of invasion by migratory pests, increased incidence of insect-transmitted plant diseases, and reduced effectiveness of biological control, especially natural enemies. As a result, there is a serious risk of crop economic losses, as well as a challenge to human food security. As a major driver of pest population dynamics, climate change will require adaptive management strategies to deal with the changing status of pests. Several priorities can be identified for future research on the effects of climatic changes on agricultural insect pests.

The continued proliferation of publications and growth of data sets, data synthesis and meta-analysis approaches allows the application of powerful tools to such questions at ever finer scales. In this analysis, we combined a literature review and effect-size meta-analysis with two large, independent, observational databases to assess how land use and management impact SOC stocks, primarily with regards to forest land uses. We performed this work for the (Great Lakes) U.S. Lake States, which comprise 6% of the land area, but 7% of the forest and 9% of the forest SOC in the United States, as the second in a series of ecoregional SOC assessments. Most importantly, our analysis indicates that natural factors, such as soil texture and parent material, exert more control over SOC stocks than land use or management. With that for context, our analysis also indicates which natural factors most influence management impacts on SOC storage. We report an overall trend of significantly diminished topsoil SOC stocks with harvesting, consistent across all three data sets, while also demonstrating how certain sites and soils diverge from this pattern, including some that show opposite trends. Impacts of fire grossly mirror those of harvesting, with declines near the top of the profile, but potential gains at depth and no net change when considering the whole profile. Land use changes showing significant SOC impacts are limited to reforestation on barren mining substrates (large and variable gains) and conversion of native forest to cultivation (losses). We describe patterns within the observational data that reveal the physical basis for preferential land use, e.g., cultivation of soils with the most favorable physical properties, and forest plantation establishment on the most marginal soils, and use these patterns to identify management opportunities and considerations.

The results showed highest C sequestration rates for the AFS-type shelterbelt in topsoils (0.92 Mg ha-1 yr-1), upper subsoils (0.72 Mg ha-1 yr-1) and lower subsoils (0.52 Mg ha-1 yr-1), followed by agrosilvicultural systems (0.70, 0.48 and 0.43 Mg ha-1 yr-1, respectively) and silvopastoral systems (0.23, 0.08 and 0.02 Mg ha-1 yr-1, respectively). We tested potential effects of different predictor variables (soil class, AFS-type, land use of the control site, system age, initial SOC stock, tree components, legumes and climatic properties) on soil C sequestration rates using a Random Forest regression model. We found changes in the conditional importance of the predictors for different soil layers. For both top- and subsoils, the AFS-type, initial SOC and soil class were most influential, followed by age. Other factors such as land use of the control, climate factors (climate zone, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation), leguminous species and tree components were of minor importance. We conclude that besides the AFS-type and the initial SOC, soil type plays a decisive role for the efficiency of soil C sequestration by agroforestry.

While eCO(2) evidently has a strong impact on photosynthesis and crop water use, it is uncertain how this will work out for the climatic and crop management conditions prevailing in southern Africa. The impact of heat stress on crop reproductive processes and the process of transpiration cooling mitigating heat stress are poorly represented in models, while both process are relevant given the climatic conditions prevailing in southern Africa.

M.",2021,"Aim The aim was to evaluate the effects of climate warming on biodiversity across spatial scales (i.e., alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity) and the effects of patch openness and experimental context on diversity responses. Location Global. Time period 1995-2017. Major taxa studied Fungi, invertebrates, phytoplankton, plants, seaweed, soil microbes and zooplankton. Methods We compiled data from warming experiments and conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of warming on different components of diversity (such as species richness and equivalent numbers) at different spatial scales (alpha-, beta- and gamma-diversity, partitioning beta-diversity into species turnover and nestedness components). We also investigated how these effects were modulated by system openness, defined as the possibility of replicates being colonized by new species, and experimental context (duration, mean temperature change and ecosystem type). Results Experimental warming did not affect local species richness (alpha-diversity) but decreased effective numbers of species by affecting species dominance. Warming increased species spatial turnover (beta-diversity), although no significant changes were detected at the regional scale (gamma-diversity). Site openness and experimental context did not significantly affect our results, despite significant heterogeneity in the effect sizes of alpha- and beta-diversity. Main conclusions Our meta-analysis shows that the effects of warming on biodiversity are scale dependent. The local and regional inventory diversity remain unaltered, whereas species composition across temperature gradients and the patterns of species dominance change with temperature, creating novel communities that might be harder to predict.","Global Ecology and Biogeography","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.13308' target='_blank'>10.1111/geb.13308</a>","&#945; &#8208; diversity; &#946; &#8208; diversity; climate change; habitat fragmentation; manipulative experiments; meta&#8208; analysis; Environmental Sciences &amp; Ecology; Physical Geography","What is the impact of climate warming on species diversity at different spatial scales",3,1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"
126784,"Soil organic carbon is affected by organic amendments, conservation tillage, and cover cropping in organic farming systems: a meta-analysis.","Crystal-Ornelas, R.; Thapa, R.; Tully, K. L.",2021,"Meta-analysis is often used to compare how soil health differs between organic and conventional farming systems. However, the burgeoning primary literature on organic farming now allows direct evaluation of the best management practices (BMPs) within organic farming systems on soil health improvements. Therefore, the main objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of BMPs, such as organic amendments, conservation tillage, and cover cropping, on soil health within organic farming systems. We focused on two principal soil health metrics: soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) concentrations. On average, adoption of BMPs increased depth-weighted SOC and MBC concentrations by 18 and 30%, respectively, relative to organically-managed control groups. Among BMPs, organic amendments and conservation tillage practices showed net positive effect on soil health with 24 and 14% increase in depth-weighted SOC concentrations, respectively. Although cover cropping did not have an overall influence on SOC concentrations, we found a temporal trend such that cover cropping significantly increased SOC concentrations after 5 years of its adoption. This indicates that the soil health benefits from BMPs accrue over time and highlights the need of long-term adoptability of BMPs to achieve agricultural sustainability. Future primary articles that focus on under-researched cropping practices in organic systems (e.g., crop rotation length and diversity, biochar addition) and the additive effects of multiple BMPs on soil health, will add to the synthesizable evidence base. Therefore, this meta-analysis confirms the soil health benefits of adopting BMPs within organic farming systems, identifies critical knowledge gaps, and provides directions for future organic farming research.","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107356' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.agee.2021.107356</a>",,"What is the effect of organic amendments, conservation tillage, and cover cropping, on soil organic carbon and microbial biomass carbon within organic farming systems?",3,1,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Beef and dairy contribute over 70% of livestock greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), which collectively contribute ~6.3 Gt CO2-eq/year (Gerber et al., 2013; Herrero et al., 2016) and account for 14%–18% of human GHG emissions (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Gerber et al., 2013). The utility of beef GHG mitigation strategies, such as land-based carbon (C) sequestration and increased production efficiency, are actively debated (Garnett et al., 2017). We compiled 292 local comparisons of “improved” versus “conventional” beef production systems across global regions, assessing net GHG emission data from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. Our results indicate that net beef GHG emissions could be reduced substantially via changes in management. Overall, a 46 % reduction in net GHG emissions per unit of beef was achieved at sites using carbon (C) sequestration management strategies on grazed lands, and an 8% reduction in net GHGs was achieved at sites using growth efficiency strategies. However, net-zero emissions were only achieved in 2% of studies. Among regions, studies from Brazil had the greatest improvement, with management strategies for C sequestration and efficiency reducing beef GHG emissions by 57%. In the United States, C sequestration strategies reduced beef GHG emissions by over 100% (net-zero emissions) in a few grazing systems, whereas efficiency strategies were not successful at reducing GHGs, possibly because of high baseline efficiency in the region. This meta-analysis offers insight into pathways to substantially reduce beef production's global GHG emissions. Nonetheless, even if these improved land-based and efficiency management strategies could be fully applied globally, the trajectory of growth in beef demand will likely more than offset GHG emissions reductions and lead to further warming unless there is also reduced beef consumption. © 2021 The Authors.

Soil aggregation contributes to the stability of soil structure and to soil C sequestration. Although many studies have reported the effects of N enrichment on bulk soil C dynamics, the underlying mechanisms explaining how soil aggregates respond to N enrichment remain unclear. Here, we used a meta-analysis of data from 76N manipulation experiments in terrestrial ecosystems in China to assess the effects of N enrichment on soil aggregation and its sequestration of C. On average, N enrichment significantly increased the mean weight diameter of soil aggregates by 10%. The proportion of macroaggregates and silt-clay fraction were significantly increased (6%) and decreased (9%) by N enrichment, respectively. A greater response of macroaggregate C (+15%) than of bulk soil C (+5%) to N enrichment was detected across all ecosystems. However, N enrichment had minor effects on microaggregate C and silt-clay C. The magnitude of N enrichment effect on soil aggregation varied with ecosystem type and fertilization regime. Additionally, soil pH declined consistently and was correlated with soil aggregate C. Overall, our meta-analysis suggests that N enrichment promotes particulate organic C accumulation via increasing macroaggregate C and acidifying soils. In contrast, increases in soil aggregation could inhibit microbially mediated breakdown of soil organic matter, causing minimal change in mineral-associated organic C. Our findings highlight that atmospheric N deposition may enhance the formation of soil aggregates and their sequestration of C in terrestrial ecosystems in China. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15604' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.15604</a>","carbon cycle; global change; meta-analysis; itrogen deposition; soil aggregation; soil carbon sequestration","What is the effect of nitrogen enrichment of soils on soil aggregation and soil sequestration of carbon in China?",3,1,2,3,2,2,2,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

We performed a meta-analysis to determine the effect of N management and other factors on N2O emissionsplant N uptakeand yield. Our analysis demonstrates that performance indicators—partial N balance and partial factor productivity—predicted N2O emissions as well as or better than N rate. While we observed consistent production and environmental benefits with enhanced-efficiency fertilizerswe noted potential trade-offs between yield and N2O emissions for fertilizer placement. Furthermorewe observed confounding effects due to management dynamics that co-vary with nutrient application practicesthus challenging the interpretation of the effect of specific practices such as fertilization frequency.

As crop and plant growth are significantly hampered under acidic soil conditions, many farmers, but increasingly as well forest managers, apply lime to raise the soil pH. Besides its direct effect on soil pH, liming also affects soil C and nutrient cycles and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed 1570 observations reported in 121 field-based studies worldwide, to assess liming effects on soil GHG fluxes and plant productivity. We found that liming significantly increases crop yield by 36.3%. Also, soil organic C (SOC) stocks were found to increase by 4.51% annually, though soil respiration is stimulated too (7.57%). Moreover, liming was found to reduce soil N2O emission by 21.3%, yield-scaled N2O emission by 21.5%, and CH4 emission and yield-scaled CH4 emission from rice paddies by 19.0% and 12.4%, respectively. Assuming that all acid agricultural soils are limed periodically, liming results in a total GHG balance benefit of 633−749 Tg CO2-eq year−1 due to reductions in soil N2O emissions (0.60−0.67 Tg N2O-N year−1) and paddy soil CH4 emissions (1.75−2.21 Tg CH4 year−1) and increases in SOC stocks (65.7–110 Tg C year−1). However, this comes at the cost of an additional CO2 release (c. 624–656 Tg CO2 year−1) deriving from lime mining, transport and application, and lime dissolution, so that the overall GHG balance is likely neutral. Nevertheless, liming of acid agricultural soils will increase yields by at least 6.64 × 108 Mg year−1, covering the food supply of 876 million people. Overall, our study shows for the first time that a general strategy of liming of acid agricultural soils is likely to result in an increasing sustainability of global agricultural production, indicating the potential benefit of liming acid soils for climate change mitigation and food security. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15607' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.15607</a>","crop yield; greenhouse gas emissions; liming; meta-analysis; soil acidification; soil organic C; soil pH","What are the effects of liming acidic arable soils on greenhouse gas fluxes and plant productivity?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

This review was undertaken to assess and synthesize the knowledge around the impacts of current and future climate on yield, quality, and climate suitability for tea; the historical roots and the most influential papers on the aforementioned topics; and the key adaptation and mitigation strategies that are practiced in tea fields. Our findings show that a large number of studies have focused on the impact of climate change on tea quality, followed by tea yield, while a smaller number of studies have concentrated on climate suitability. Three pronounced reference peaks found in Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RYPS) represent the most significant papers associated with the yield, quality, and climate suitability for tea. Tea yield increases with elevated CO2 levels, but this increment could be substantially affected by an increasing temperature. Other climatic factors are uneven rainfall, extreme weather events, and climate-driven abiotic stressors. An altered climate presents both advantages and disadvantages for tea quality due to the uncertainty of the concentrations of biochemicals in tea leaves. Climate change creates losses, gains, and shifts of climate suitability for tea habitats. Further studies are required in order to fill the knowledge gaps identified through the present review, such as an investigation of the interaction between the tea plant and multiple environmental factors that mimic real-world conditions and then studies on its impact on the tea system, as well as the design of ensemble modeling approaches to predict climate suitability for tea.

X.; Liang Chao; An ShaoShan",2021,"Soil microbial diversity is one of the key factors affecting the structure and function of the belowground ecosystem; yet, little is known about the response of microbial diversity to multiple global change factors. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis based on data collected from 237 published papers to explore the effect of multiple global change factors (elevated carbon dioxide (eCO2), warming, elevated nitrogen addition (eN), wetting-drying cycle, drought, decreased precipitation (precipitation(-)), and increased precipitation (precipitation(+))) on microbial diversity (Shannon index) across different ecosystems (cropland, grassland, forest, shrubland, desert, wetland, and tundra). Global change decreased soil bacterial and fungal diversity by an average of 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively. For each global change factor, the effect sizes of precipitation(-), eN, wetting-drying cycle, and drought on soil microbial diversity were negative, whereas the effect sizes of eCO2, warming, and precipitation(+) were positive. This phenomenon was driven by changes in mean annual temperature (MAT) and edaphic factors (especially soil pH, bulk density and organic carbon content) rather than mean annual precipitation. Moreover, the effect size of soil microbial diversity linearly declined with increasing MAT, suggesting that microbial diversity was highly dependent on climate conditions at the global scale. In addition, two- and three-way interactions of global change factors aggravated the negative effects of individual effects. We suggest that it is essential to conduct long-term, multiple-factor experiments to assess the response of soil microbial diversity to global change because multiple global change factors often occur simultaneously.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108229' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108229</a>",,"What are the effects of multiple global change factors on soil microbial diversity?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Changes in the environment at high altitude and high latitude regions, as a consequence of climate change, will significantly affect these life stages and may have profound effects on species recruitment and survival. Here, we synthesize the current knowledge of climate change effects on treeline, tundra, and alpine plants’ early life-history stages. We systematically searched the available literature on this subject up until February 2020 and recovered 835 potential articles that matched our search terms. From these, we found 39 studies that matched our selection criteria. We characterized the studies within our review and performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the extracted meta-data regarding the climatic effects likely to change in these regions, including projected warming, early snowmelt, changes in precipitation, nutrient availability and their effects on seed maturation, seed dormancy, germination, seedling emergence and seedling establishment. Although the studies showed high variability in their methods and studied species, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the extracted data allowed us to detect existing patterns and knowledge gaps. For example, warming temperatures seemed to favor all studied life stages except seedling establishment, a decrease in precipitation had a strong negative effect on seed stages and, surprisingly, early snowmelt had a neutral effect on seed dormancy and germination but a positive effect on seedling establishment. For some of the studied life stages, data within the literature were too limited to identify a precise effect. There is still a need for investigations that increase our understanding of the climate change impacts on high altitude and high latitude plants’ reproductive processes, as this is crucial for plant conservation and evidence-based management of these environments.

However, testing patterns of combined responses of plants and soils remains a knowledge gap for terrestrial ecosystems. We carried out a comprehensive review of the available literature and conducted a meta-analysis to explore combined plant and soil microbial responses in grasslands exposed to experimental precipitation changes. We measured the effects of experimental precipitation changes on plant biomass, biomass allocation, and soil microbial biomass and tested for trade-offs between plant and soil responses to altered precipitation. We found that aboveground and belowground plant biomass responded asynchronically to precipitation changes, thereby leading to shifts in plant biomass allocation. Belowground plant biomass did not change under precipitation changes, but aboveground plant biomass decreased in precipitation reduction and increased in precipitation addition. There was a trade-off between responses of aboveground plant biomass and belowground plant biomass to precipitation reduction, but correlation wasn't found for precipitation addition. Microbial biomass carbon (C) did not change under the treatments of precipitation reduction. Increased root allocation may buffer drought stress for soil microbes through root exudations and neutralize microbial responses to precipitation reduction. However, precipitation addition increased microbial biomass C, potentially reflecting the removal of water limitation for soil microbial growth. We found that there were positive correlations between responses of aboveground plant biomass and microbial biomass C to precipitation addition, indicating that increased shoot growth probably promoted microbial responses via litter inputs. In sum, our study suggested that aboveground, belowground plant biomass and soil microbial biomass can respond asynchronically to precipitation changes, and emphasizes that testing the plant-soil system as a whole is necessary for forecasting the effects of precipitation changes on grassland systems. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang and Xi.","Frontiers in Plant Science","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.614968' target='_blank'>10.3389/fpls.2021.614968</a>","aboveground-belowground interaction; asynchrony; carbon stock; grasslands; optimal biomass allocation; precipitation","What are the impacts of increased or decreased rainfall on plant biomass, microbial biomass carbon, and soil moisture?",2,1,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,"Evidence Review"
126727,"The role of climate change in pollinator decline across the Northern Hemisphere is underestimated","Vasiliev, D.; Greenwood, S.",2021,"Pollinator biodiversity loss occurs at unprecedented rates globally, with particularly sharp declines documented in the North Temperate Zone. There is currently no consensus on the main drivers of the decline. Although climate change is expected to drive biodiversity loss in the future, current warming is often suggested to have positive impacts on pollinator assemblages in higher latitudes. Consequently, pollinator conservation initiatives in Europe and the USA tend to lack climate adaptation initiatives, an omission of which may be risky if climate change has significant negative impacts on pollinators. To gain an understanding of the impacts of climate change on pollinator biodiversity in the Northern Hemisphere, we conducted a literature review on genetic, species and community level diversity. Our findings suggest that global heating most likely causes homogenization of pollinator assemblages at all levels of pollinator biodiversity, making them less resilient to future stochasticity. Aspects of biodiversity that are rarely measured (e.g. genetic diversity, β-diversity, species evenness) tend to be most affected, while some dimensions of climate change, such as fluctuations in winter weather conditions, changes in the length of the vegetational season and increased frequency of extreme weather events, that seldom receive attention in empirical studies, tend to be particularly detrimental to pollinators. Negative effects of global heating on pollinator biodiversity are most likely exacerbated by homogenous and fragmented landscapes, widespread across Europe and the US, which limit opportunities for range-shifts and reduce micro-climatic buffering. This suggests the need for conservation initiatives to focus on increasing landscape connectivity and heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Science of the Total Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145788' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145788</a>",,"What is the impact of climate change on pollinator biodiversity at genetic, species and community levels in the Northern Hemisphere?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Internalize the externalities, the logic goes, and polluters will change their behavior. The theory is elegant, but has carbon pricing worked in practice? Despite a voluminous literature on the topic, there are surprisingly few works that conduct an ex-post analysis, examining how carbon pricing has actually performed. This paper provides a meta-review of ex-post quantitative evaluations of carbon pricing policies around the world since 1990. Four findings stand out. First, though carbon pricing has dominated many political discussions of climate change, only 37 studies assess the actual effects of the policy on emissions reductions, and the vast majority of these are focused on Europe. Second, the majority of studies suggest that the aggregate reductions from carbon pricing on emissions are limited-generally between 0% and 2% per year. However, there is considerable variation across sectors. Third, in general, carbon taxes perform better than emissions trading schemes (ETSs). Finally, studies of the EU-ETS, the oldest ETS, indicate limited average annual reductions-ranging from 0% to 1.5% per annum. For comparison, the IPCC states that emissions must fall by 45% below 2010 levels by 2030 in order to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C-the goal set by the Paris Agreement (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2018).

In addition, this study found that 121-320 kg N ha-1 and ≤ 30 T ha-1 application rates of animal manure and biochar mitigated N2O emissions by 72.3% and 22.5%, respectively. Soil pH also played a vital role in regulating the N2O emissions after organic amendments. Furthermore, &gt; 10 soil C: N ratios increased N2O emissions by 121.4% and 27.6% after animal and biochar amendments, respectively. Overall, animal manure C: N ratios significantly enhanced N2O emissions, while, biochar C: N ratio had not shown any effect on N2O emissions. Overall, average N2O emission factors (EFs) for animal manure and biochar amendments were 0.46% and -0.08%, respectively. Thus, the results of this meta-analysis study provide scientific evidence about how organic amendments such as animal manure and biochar regulating the N2O emission from agricultural soils.","Journal of Environmental Management","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112170' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112170</a>",,"What is the effect of application of animal manure or biochar on nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soils?",3,1,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

While the individual effects of environmental change and of weeds on crop yield have been assessed, the combined effects have not been broadly characterized. To explore the simultaneous impacts of weeds with changes in climate-related environmental conditions on future food production, we conducted a meta-analysis of 171 observations measuring the individual and combined effects of weeds and elevated CO2, drought or warming on 23 crop species. The combined effect of weeds and environmental change tended to be additive. On average, weeds reduced crop yield by 28%, a value that was not significantly different from the simultaneous effect of weeds and environmental change (27%), due to increased variability when acting together. The negative effect of weeds on crop yield was mitigated by elevated CO2 and warming, but added to the negative effect of drought. The impact of weeds with environmental change was also dependent on the photosynthetic pathway of the weed/crop pair and on crop identity. Native and non-native weeds had similarly negative effects on yield, with or without environmental change. Weed impact with environmental change was also independent of whether the crop was infested with a single or multiple weed species. Since weed impacts remain negative under environmental change, our results highlight the need to evaluate the efficacy of different weed management practices under climate change. Understanding that the effects of environmental change and weeds are, on average, additive brings us closer to developing useful forecasts of future crop performance. © 2021 The Author(s).

E.",2021,"Increasing the quantity and quality of plant biomass production in space and time can improve the capacity of agroecosystems to capture and store atmospheric carbon (C) in the soil. Cover cropping is a key practice to increase system net primary productivity (NPP) and increase the quantity of high-quality plant residues available for integration into soil organic matter (SOM). Cover crop management and local environmental conditions, however, influence the magnitude of soil C stock change. Here, we used a comprehensive meta-analysis approach to quantify the effect of cover crops on soil C stocks from the 0-30 cm soil depth in temperate climates and to identify key management and ecological factors that impact variation in this response. A total of 40 publications with 181 observations were included in the meta-analysis representing six countries across three different continents. Overall, cover crops had a strong positive effect on soil C stocks (P < 0.0001) leading to a 12% increase, averaging 1.11 Mg C/ha more soil C relative to a no cover crop control. The strongest predictors of SOC response to cover cropping were planting and termination date (i.e., growing window), annual cover crop biomass production, and soil clay content. Cover crops planted as continuous cover or autumn planted and terminated led to 20-30% greater total soil C stocks relative to other cover crop growing windows. Likewise, high annual cover crop biomass production (>7 Mg center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)) resulted in 30% higher total soil C stocks than lower levels of biomass production. Managing for greater NPP by improving synchronization in cover crop growing windows and climate will enhance the capacity of this practice to drawdown carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere across agroecosystems. The integration of growing window (potentially as a proxy for biomass growth), climate, and soil factors in decision-support tools are relevant for improving the quantification of soil C stock change under cover crops, particularly with the expansion of terrestrial soil C markets.","Ecological Applications","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2278' target='_blank'>10.1002/eap.2278</a>","agroecosystem; cover crop; diversity; meta; analysis; egative; emissions technology; et primary productivity; soil organic carbon; Environmental Sciences &amp; Ecology","What is the effect of using cover crops on soil organic carbon?",3,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

We aimed to establish how experimentally altered litter inputs affect soil C to 1-m depth across different ecosystems, and over different timeframes. Methods We performed a meta-analysis of 237 studies across 248 sites worldwide to assess the influence of treatment magnitude, treatment duration, initial soil C content, and climate on the response of soil C to altered aboveground litter inputs. Results Overall, soil C content was lower under litter removal, but higher under litter addition compared to controls. The effects of litter manipulation were apparent throughout the soil profile and were related to treatment magnitude. Soil C content declined markedly with increasing duration of litter removal, whereas the positive effect of litter addition attenuated over time. Cropland management practices (bare fallow or additional straw incorporation) had similar effects on soil C to litter removal and addition treatments. Conclusions Our study reveals rapid and consistent changes in soil C content with altered litter inputs and provides important insights into plant residue management to enhance soil C sequestration.

Using data from 95 studies on a global level, we investigated the changes of various SOC fractions in 0-400 mm [dissolved organic C (DOC), particulate organic C (POC), easily oxidizable organic C (EOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), and mineral-associated organic C (MOC)] with NT application. This study also quantified the roles of different environmental and agronomic factors (e.g., climatic conditions, soil texture and nutrient conditions, study duration, and cropping intensity) in the changes of these SOC fractions. Compared to conventional tillage (CT), NT and reduced tillage (RT; tillage systems that are less intensive, with fewer trips in the field than CT) increased SOC concentrations, which were 7.4% higher in NT than in RT (percentage change based on weighted response ratio). Compared with CT, NT significantly increased DOC (17.6%), POC (11.7%), EOC (14.8%), MBC (33.1%), and MOC concentration (16.0%). Furthermore, POC, MBC, and MOC concentrations were 8.2, 34.1, and 4.4% higher in NT than in RT, respectively. Importantly, the increased SOC concentrations under NT were significantly correlated with MBC (R2 = 0.62) and POC (R2 = 0.55). Soil depth and mean annual temperature were the dominant factors affecting the response ratios of SOC fractions (DOC, EOC, MBC, MOC, and POC) under NT, followed by the duration of NT application. Our results suggest that SOC fractions, especially those driving soil biological activities (rather than total SOC), should be considered when evaluating the effects of conservation tillage practices on SOC sequestration.

In this article, the studies on impacts of forest fires on the permafrost environment are reviewed. These studies indicate that forest fires could result in an irreversible degradation of permafrost, successions of boreal forests, rapid losses of soil carbon stock, and increased hazardous periglacial landforms. After forest fires, soil temperatures rise; active layer thickens; the release of soil carbon and nitrogen enhances, and; vegetation changes from coniferous forests to broad-leaved forests, shrublands or grasslands. It may take decades or even centuries for the fire-disturbed ecosystems and permafrost environment to return to pre-fire conditions, if ever possible. In boreal forest, the thickness of organic layer has a key influence on changes in permafrost and vegetation. In addition, climate warming, change of vegetation, shortening of fire return intervals, and extent of fire range and increasing of fire severity may all modify the change trajectory of the fire-impacted permafrost environment. However, the observations and research on the relationships and interactive mechanisms among the forest fires, vegetation, carbon cycle and permafrost under a changing climate are still inadequate for a systematic impact evaluation. Using the chronosequence approach of evaluating the temporal changes by measuring changes in the permafrost environment at different stages at various sites (possibly representing varied stages of permafrost degradation and modes), multi-source data assimilation and model predictions and simulations should be integrated with the results from long- and short-term field investigations, geophysical investigations and airborne surveys, laboratory testing and remote sensing. Future studies may enable quantitatively assess and predict the feed-back relationship and influence mechanism among organic layer, permafrost and active layer processes, vegetation and soil carbon under a warming climate at desired spatial and temporal scales.

Since the industrial revolution, ~30% of anthropogenic CO2 has been absorbed by the global oceans. Average surface seawater pH levels have already decreased by 0.1 and are projected to decline by ~0.3 by the year 2100. This process, known as ocean acidification (OA), is shallowing the saturation horizon, which is the depth below which calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolves, likely increasing the vulnerability of many resident marine calcifiers to dissolution. The negative impact of OA may be seen first in species depositing more soluble CaCO3 mineral phases such as aragonite and high-Mg calcite (HMC). Ocean warming could further exacerbate the effects of OA in these particular species. Here we combine a review and a quantitative meta-analysis to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge about skeletal mineralogy of major taxonomic groups of SO marine calcifiers and to make projections about how OA might affect a broad range of SO taxa. We consider a species' geographic range, skeletal mineralogy, biological traits, and potential strategies to overcome OA. The meta-analysis of studies investigating the effects of the OA on a range of biological responses such as shell state, development and growth rate illustrates that the response variation is largely dependent on mineralogical composition. Species-specific responses due to mineralogical composition indicate that taxa with calcitic, aragonitic, and HMC skeletons, could be at greater risk to expected future carbonate chemistry alterations, and low-Mg calcite (LMC) species could be mostly resilient to these changes. Environmental and biological control on the calcification process and/or Mg content in calcite, biological traits, and physiological processes are also expected to influence species-specific responses. © Copyright © 2021 Figuerola, Hancock, Bax, Cummings, Downey, Griffiths, Smith and Stark.","Frontiers in Marine Science","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.584445' target='_blank'>10.3389/fmars.2021.584445</a>","Antarctica; aragonite; carbonate mineralogy; climate change; magnesium; saturation horizon; vulnerability","What is the impact of altered seawater carbonate chemistry due to ocean acidification on Southern Ocean marine calcifiers?",3,1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

With the intensification of climate warming, solutions to these problems are becoming increasingly more important. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of research on global soil erosion to verify the effects of climate warming on soil erosion. Four databases were searched for relevant peer-reviewed publications from 1980 to 2019 using five keywords.

However, few studies have quantitatively investigated the effects of a range of CSA practices on crop yield, soil carbon, and nitrogen pools. This study adds to this limited body of work by synthesizing such studies and evaluates the effect of individual and combinations of widely implemented CSA practices in Africa-green manure (GM), conservation tillage (no-tillage, reduced tillage), and crop residue retention (CR)-on food crop yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, and soil total nitrogen (TN). Materials and methods This study conducted a meta-analysis of results reported in 60 peer-reviewed articles to examine the effects of CSA management (GM, CR, and conservation tillage) on crop yield, SOC concentration, and soil TN in Africa. Results and discussion The implementation of CSA practices significantly increased crop yield and SOC concentrations (mean effect 9.2% and 14.7%, respectively), although no significant change was evident in soil TN. In terms of yield increase, GM was the most effective practice, increasing yield by 63.5%, followed by CR (5.8%). Conservation tillage and CR increased SOC by 16.4% and 13%, respectively, but no significant difference was observed with GM. Further analysis suggested that integrating CSA practices (conservation tillage and GM; conservation tillage and CR) had a more pronounced effect on both SOC concentration and yield under lower nitrogen fertilizer levels. Conclusion Our meta-analysis showed that CSA management resulted in higher yields and SOC concentrations, thus suggesting the importance of CSA practices in enhancing food production and climate mitigation in Africa.

Deep fertilization has been demonstrated to increase crop yield and nutrient use efficiency by decreasing losses of volatilization and surface runoff. However, N2O emissions from croplands induced by deep fertilization are variable and mitigation strategies remain uncertain. This study aimed to (i) quantify the response of area-scaled (N2O emissions) and yield-scaled N2O emissions (N2O intensity) from croplands to deep fertilization, and (ii) identify the soil, climate, and management factors that mitigate N2O emissions and N2O intensity under deep fertilization. RESULTS: Compared with the control, deep fertilization increased N2O emissions by 18.6% (P &lt; 0.001) but decreased N2O intensity by 20.1% (P = 0.018).

Humid (extremely wet, moderately wet, and slightly wet), temperate, and arid (slight drought, moderate drought and extreme drought) areas were classified according to the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI).

Ensuring the long-term sustainability of grazing lands requires optimal management to simultaneously balance livestock productivity for sustaining human food and nutritional demands while reducing environmental impacts, such as greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and soil degradation. In this paper, we revisit grazing management in grazing lands exposed to different grazing systems. In Section 2, we briefly review parameterization and multi-faceted goals for sustainability of grazing systems considering broader sustainability from economic to environmental aspects. We also discuss the inconsistencies between grazing researchers and ranchers’ practices. In Section 3, we review the separate experimental data to examine the impacts of multi-paddock rotational grazing on soil carbon, nutrient and GHGs. In Section 4, we present status and upcoming challenges in monitoring and upscaling of grazing ecosystem research and management. In Section 5, new concepts of multiple source monitoring networks are presented that enable the analysis of scale-dependent processes. Finally, we point out future directions for monitoring and assessment of managing soil C and GHG emissions from grazing lands. The results show that the inconsistences are essentially due to (1) effects of spatiotemporal scales on both economic and ecological outcomes, and (2) simplistic representations of multi-faceted grazing systems and sustainability.

The average SOC sequestration rate of SCS management was 7.53 Mg CO2-eq. ha−1 yr−1 to a 30-cm soil depth. The highest SOC sequestration rate (11.06 Mg CO2-eq. ha−1 yr−1) was achieved under a combination of OA+NT and the lowest (2.82 Mg CO2-eq. ha−1 yr−1) was observed under PR treatments. Field experiments performed in particularly hot and dry bioclimatic zones were associated with lower SOC sequestration rates relative to those performed in more temperate areas. The high SOC sequestration rates obtained for many SCS practices, and the large land area dedicated to viticulture worldwide (7.45 Mha), imply that the adoption of SCS practices in vineyards can contribute to the global efforts to offset atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations via SOC sequestration to mitigate climate change. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Journal of Cleaner Production","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125736' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125736</a>",,"What are the effects of soil management practices on soil organic carbon stocks in vineyard agroecosystems?",3,1,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,3,"Evidence Review"

Research into this area has been rapidly expanding, but knowledge gaps still exist. We conducted a review of the literature to provide a synthesis of extreme climate events on insects and identify future areas of research. In our review, we asked the following questions: 1) What are the direct and indirect mechanisms that extreme climate events affect individual insects? 2) What are the effects of extreme climate events on insect populations and demography? 3) What are the implications of the extreme climate events effects on insect communities? Drought was among the most frequently described type of extreme climate event affecting insects, as well as the effects of temperature extremes and extreme temperature variation. Our review explores the factors that determine the sensitivity or resilience to climate extremes for individuals, populations, and communities. We also identify areas of future research to better understand the role of extreme climate events on insects including effects on non-trophic interactions, alteration of population dynamics, and mediation of the functional the trait set of communities.

Over the past decades, three major challenges to marine life have emerged as a consequence of anthropogenic emissions: ocean warming, acidification and oxygen loss. While most experimental research has targeted the first two stressors, the last remains comparatively neglected. Here, we implemented sequential hierarchical mixed-model meta-analyses (721 control-treatment comparisons) to compare the impacts of oxygen conditions associated with the current and continuously intensifying hypoxic events (1-3.5 O-2 mg l(-1)) with those experimentally yielded by ocean warming (+4 degrees C) and acidification (-0.4 units) conditions on the basis of IPCC projections (RCP 8.5) for 2100. In contrast to warming and acidification, hypoxic events elicited consistent negative effects relative to control biological performance-survival (-33%), abundance (-65%), development (-51%), metabolism (-33%), growth (-24%) and reproduction (-39%)-across the taxonomic groups (mollusks, crustaceans and fish), ontogenetic stages and climate regions studied.

However, emerging findings suggest that NIs may increase soil ammonia (NH3) volatilization and, subsequently, indirect N2O emission. A quantitative synthesis is lacking to evaluate how NIs may affect NH3 volatilization and the overall N2O emissions under different environmental conditions. In this meta-analysis, we quantified the responses of NH3 volatilization to NI application with 234 observations from 89 individual studies and analysed the role of experimental method, soil properties, fertilizer/NI type, fertilizer application rate and land use type as explanatory factors. Furthermore, using data sets where soil NH3 emission and N2O emission were measured simultaneously, we re-evaluated the effect of NI on overall N2O emissions including indirect N2O emission from NH3 volatilization. We found that, on average, NIs increased NH3 volatilization by 35.7% (95% CI: 25.7–46.7%) and increased indirect N2O emission from NH3 emission (and subsequent N deposition) by 2.9%–15.2%. Responses of NH3 volatilization mainly varied with experimental method, soil pH, NI type and fertilizer type. The increase of NH3 volatilization following NI application showed a positive correlation with soil pH (R2 = 0.04, n = 234, P &lt; 0.05) and N fertilizer rate (R2 = 0.04, n = 187, P &lt; 0.05). When the indirect N2O emission was considered, NI's N2O mitigation effect decreased from 48.0% to 39.7% (EF = 1%), or 28.2% (EF = 5%). The results indicate that using DMPP with ammonium-based fertilizer in low pH, high SOC soils would have a lower risk for increasing NH3 volatilization than using DCD and nitrapyrin with urea in high pH, lower SOC soil.

However, the effect of substituting synthetic fertilizer with organic fertilizer on vegetable productivity (yield, N uptake and nitrogen use efficiency) and reactive nitrogen (Nr) losses (N2O emission, N leaching and NH3 volatilization) remains unclear. A meta-analysis was performed using peer-reviewed papers published from 2000 to 2019 to comprehensively assess the effects of combined application of organic and synthetic N fertilizers. The results indicate that overall, the vegetable yield, N2O emission and NH3 volatilization were not significantly changed, whereas N leaching was reduced by 44.6% and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration increased by 12.5% compared to synthetic N fertilizer alone. Specifically, when synthetic N substitution rates (SRs) were ≤70%, vegetable yields and SOC concentration were increased by 5.5%–5.6% and 13.1–18.0%, and N leaching was reduced by 41.6%–48.1%. At the high substitution rate (SR&gt;70%), vegetable yield was reduced by 13.6%, N2O emission was reduced by 14.3%, and SOC concentration increased by 16.4%. Mixed animal-plant sources of organic N preferentially increased vegetable yield and SOC concentration, and reduced N2O emission and N leaching compared with single sources of organic-N.

The results showed that, compared to reference (non-thinned) plantations, thinning significantly increased SOC stocks in planted forests by 7.2%. Among different thinning intensities, moderate thinning (35–55% of thinning intensity) increased SOC stocks in planted forests (+16.1%) more than other levels of thinning intensity. However, the positive effect of thinning on SOC stock was significant > 5 years after harvesting. In the humidity-restricted areas (humidity index (HI) < 30), the increase in SOC stocks after thinning was significantly higher than that of other areas. In addition, thinning increased the sensitivity (i.e. slope value) of soil total nitrogen (TN) stocks changes to SOC stocks.

A.",2020,"Biofuel production from crop residues is widely recognized as an essential component of developing a bioeconomy, but the removal of crop residues still raises many questions about the sustainability of the cropping system. Therefore, this study reviews the sustainability effects of crop residues removal for biofuel production in terms of crop production, soil health and greenhouse gas emissions. Most studies found little evidence that residue management had long-term impacts on grain yield unless the available water is limited. In years when water was not limiting, corn and wheat removal rates >= 90% produced similar or greater grain yield than no removal in most studies. Conversely, when water was limiting, corn grain yield decreased up to 21% with stover removal >= 90% in some studies. Changes in soil organic fractions and nutrients depended largely on the amount of residue returned, soil depth and texture, slope and tillage. Reductions in organic fractions occurred primarily with complete stover removal, in the top 15-30 cm in fine-textured soils. Soil erosion, water runoff and leaching of nutrients such as total nitrogen (N) and extractable soil potassium decreased when no more than 30% of crop residues were removed. Stover management effects on soil bulk density varied considerably depending on soil layer, and residue and tillage management, with removal rates of less than 50% helping to maintain the soil aggregate stability. Reductions in CO2 and N2O fluxes typically occurred following complete residue removal. The use of wheat straw typically increased CH4 emissions, and above or equal to 8 Mg/ha wheat straw led to the largest CO2 and N2O emissions, regardless of N rates. Before using crop residues for biofuel production, it should therefore always be checked whether neutral to positive sustainability effects can be maintained under the site-specific conditions.","Global Change Biology Bioenergy","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12774' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcbb.12774</a>",,"What is the impact of crop residue (corn stover and wheat straw) removal on crop productivity, soil health and greenhouse gas emissions?",3,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,2,"Evidence Review"

For the reduction of ammonia emissions, different management steps have been reported in most EU countries. Some authors, however, have criticized such individual measures, because attempts to abate the emission of ammonia may lead to significant increases in either methane, nitrous oxide, or carbon dioxide. In this study, we carried out a meta-analysis of experimental European data published in peer-reviewed journals to evaluate the impact of major agricultural management practices on ammonia emissions, including the pollution swapping effect. The result of our meta-analysis showed that for the treatment, storage, and application stages, only slurry acidification was effective for the reduction of ammonia emissions (−69%), and had no pollution swapping effect with other greenhouse gases, like nitrous oxide (−21%), methane (−86%), and carbon dioxide (−15%). All other management strategies, like biological treatment, separation strategies, different storage types, the concealing of the liquid slurry with different materials, and variable field applications were effective to varying degrees for the abatement of ammonia emission, but also resulted in the increased emission of at least one other greenhouse gas. The strategies focusing on the decrease of ammonia emissions neglected the consequences of the emissions of other greenhouse gases.

The establishment of forests and planting of trees changes surface and subsurface hydrology, often delaying peak discharge and reducing overland flow and flood risk. However, it is increasingly recognised that a blanket recommendation to 'plant trees' is rarely an efficient approach to flood-risk management. This is because the role of trees varies spatially and temporally as a function of climate, topography, rainfall properties, soil type and condition, catchment scale and geology, among others. This paper presents a review of the complex relationship between tree cover and flooding. It discusses how the interaction is affected by species, position in the landscape, catchment scale, soils, magnitude of rainfall event and changing geologic and climatic conditions.

A.",2020,"The cost-effective mitigation of climate change through nature-based carbon dioxide removal strategies has gained substantial policy attention. Inland and coastal wetlands (specifically boreal, temperate and tropical peatlands; tundra; floodplains; freshwater marshes; saltmarshes; and mangroves) are among the most efficient natural long-term carbon sinks. Yet, they also release methane (CH4) that can offset the carbon they sequester. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis on wetland carbon dynamics to (i) determine their impact on climate using different metrics and time horizons, (ii) investigate the cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation, and (iii) discuss their suitability for inclusion in climate policy as negative emission technologies. Depending on metrics, a wetland can simultaneously be a net carbon sink (i.e. boreal and temperate peatlands net ecosystem carbon budget = -28.1 ± 19.13 gC m-2 y-1) but have a net warming effect on climate at the 100 years time-scale (i.e. boreal and temperate peatland sustained global warming potential = 298.2 ± 100.6 gCO2 eq-1 m-2 y-1). This situation creates ambivalence regarding the effect of wetlands on global temperature. Moreover, our review reveals high heterogeneity among the (limited number of) studies that document wetland carbon budgets. We demonstrate that most coastal and inland wetlands have a net cooling effect as of today. This is explained by the limited CH4 emissions that undisturbed coastal wetlands produce, and the long-term carbon sequestration performed by older inland wetlands as opposed to the short lifetime of CH4 in the atmosphere. Analysis of wetland restoration costs relative to the amount of carbon they can sequester revealed that restoration is more cost-effective in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (US$1800 ton C-1) compared with inland wetlands (US$4200-49 200 ton C-1). We advise that for inland wetlands, priority should be given to conservation rather than restoration; while for coastal wetlands, both conservation and restoration may be effective techniques for climate change mitigation.","Interface Focus","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsfs.2019.0129' target='_blank'>10.1098/rsfs.2019.0129</a>",,"What is the effect of wetland restoration on its net ecosystem carbon budget?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

However, the effects of grazing at different intensities and durations on the dynamics of soil C in its subsoil layers are not clearly understood. Here, we compiled data from 78 sites (in total 122 published studies) to examine the effects of varying grazing intensities and durations on soil C content at different depths for grasslands in China. Our meta-analysis revealed that grazing led to an overall decrease in soil C content and productivity of above-ground vegetation (e.g., above-ground biomass and litter) but an increase in below-ground biomass. Specifically, the effects of grazing on soil C content became less negative or even positive with increasing soil depths. An increase of soil C content was consequently found under light grazing (LG), although soil C content still decreased under moderate and heavy grazing. The increase in soil C content under LG could be largely attributed to the increase of soil C content in subsoil layers (>20 cm), despite that soil C content in surface soil layer (0–20 cm) decreased. Moreover, the magnitude of increase in soil C content under LG in subsoil layers increased with grazing duration. A possible reason of the increase in soil C content in the subsoil layers was due to the increases in below-ground biomass.

Abstract: The responses of crop yields to climatic warming have been extensively reported from experimental results, historical yield collections, and modeling research. However, an integrative report on the responses of plant biomass and yield components of three major crops to experimental warming is lacking. Here, a meta-analysis based on the most recent warming experiments was conducted to quantify the climatic warming responses of the biomass, grain yield (GY), and yield components of three staple crops. The results showed that the wheat total aboveground biomass (TAGB) increased by 6.0% with general warming, while the wheat GY did not significantly respond to warming; however, the responses shifted with increases in the mean growing season temperature (MGST). Negative effects on wheat TAGB and GY appeared when the MGSTs were above 15 °C and 13 °C, respectively. The wheat GY and the number of grains per panicle decreased by 8.4% and 7.5%, respectively, per degree Celsius increase. Increases in temperature significantly reduced the rice TAGB and GY by 4.3% and 16.6%, respectively, but rice straw biomass increased with increasing temperature. However, the rice grain weight and the number of panicles decreased with continuous increasing temperature (ΔTa). The maize biomass, GY, and yield components all generally decreased with climatic warming.

Despite the importance of N fixation in terrestrial ecosystems, our knowledge regarding the controls on terrestrial N fixation remains poor. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis (based on 852 observations from 158 studies) of N fixation across three types of ecosystems with different status of disturbance (no management, restoration [previously disturbed], and disturbance [currently disturbed]) and in response to multiple environmental change factors (warming, elevated carbon dioxide [CO2], increased precipitation, increased drought, increased N deposition, and their combinations). We explored the mechanisms underlying the changes in N fixation by examining the variations in soil physicochemical properties (bulk density, texture, moisture, and pH), plant and microbial characteristics (dominant plant species numbers, plant coverage, and soil microbial biomass), and soil resources (total carbon, total N, total phosphorus (P), inorganic N, and inorganic P). Human disturbance inhibited non-symbiotic N fixation but not symbiotic N fixation. Terrestrial N fixation was stimulated by warming (+152.7%), elevated CO2 (+19.6%), and increased precipitation (+73.1%) but inhibited by increased drought (−30.4%), N deposition (−31.0%), and combinations of available multiple environmental change factors (−14.5%), the extents of which varied among biomes and ecosystem compartments. Human disturbance reduced the N fixation responses to environmental change factors, which was associated with the changes in soil physicochemical properties (2%‒56%, p &lt;.001) and the declines in plant and microbial characteristics (3%‒49%, p ≤.003) and soil resources (6%‒48%, p ≤.03). Overall, our findings reveal for the first time the effects of multiple environmental change factors on terrestrial N fixation and indicate the role of human disturbance activities in inhibiting N fixation, which can improve our understanding, modeling, and prediction of terrestrial N budgets, NPP, and ecosystem feedbacks under global change scenarios. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15328' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.15328</a>","biological nitrogen fixation; environmental change; global change; human disturbance; itrogen cycling; terrestrial ecosystems","What is the impact of different levels of human disturbance and global climate change factors on nitrogen fixation rates in global terrestrial soils, plants, and lichens?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

However, a comprehensive assessment of the response of soil CH4 uptake to land degradation and restoration at global scale is not available. Here, we present a global meta-analysis with a database of 228 observations from 83 studies to investigate the effects of land degradation and restoration on the capacity of soil CH4 uptake. We found that land degradation significantly decreased the capacity of soil CH4 uptake, except the conversion of pasture to cropland where the soil CH4 uptake rate showed no response. In contrast, all types of land restoration significantly increased the capacity of soil CH4 uptake. Interestingly, the response of soil CH4 uptake rate to land degradation and restoration was asymmetric: the increased soil CH4 uptake rate in response to the land restoration was smaller compared to the decrease in CH4 uptake rate induced by the land degradation. The effect of land degradation on soil CH4 uptake rate was not dependent on the time since land use change, but the CH4 sink strength increased with the time since land restoration. The response of soil CH4 uptake rate to both land degradation and restoration was predominantly regulated by changes in the soil water-filled pore space, soil bulk density, and pH, whereas alterations in the substrate quantity and quality had negligible effect. Additionally, the effects of land degradation and restoration on soil CH4 uptake were strongly related to the mean annual precipitation and soil texture. Overall, our results provide novel insights for understanding of how land degradation and restoration can affect the CH4 sink strength of upland soils, and more importantly, our findings are beneficial to take measures to enhance the potential of soil CH4 uptake in response to global land use change. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15315' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.15315</a>","afforestation; deforestation; methane uptake; soil microenvironment; time since land use change; upland soils","What is the impact of upland land use change (degradation and restoration) on upland soil methane uptake rate?",2,1,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

It is therefore not surprising that improving tolerance to drought and heat combination has been a major goal for breeders and biotech companies. Although much is known about the physiological and molecular responses of vegetative tissues to a combination of drought and heat stress, less is known about the impact of this stress combination on yield and different yield components. Here, we used a meta-analysis approach to synthesize results from over 120 published case studies of crop responses to combined drought and heat stress. Our findings reveal that drought and heat stress combination significantly impacts yield by decreasing harvest index, shortening the life cycle of crops, and altering seed number, size and composition. Furthermore, these impacts are more severe when the stress combination is applied during the reproductive stage of plants. We further identify differences in how legumes and cereals respond to the stress combination and reveal that utilizing C3 or C4 metabolism may not provide an advantage to plants during stress combinations.

M.",2020,"The potential for soils to produce nitrous oxide (N2O) is impacted by past moisture conditions; however, the extent of this impact is not fully understood. We conducted the first review of this, using two literature searches and a meta-analysis. We found 36 studies out of a possible 735 that described experiments where soil moisture conditions had been controlled, such that the impact of antecedent moisture levels could be separated from contemporary moisture levels and attributed to N2O emissions. Of those studies, 14 (130 data points) used the appropriate experimental design and presented suitable data that could be standardized for the meta-analysis. We found that the degree to which the soil was rewetted and the water filled pore space (WFPS) the soil was brought to were significant explanatory variables (p= < 0.0001). The larger the difference between the dry and wet states of the soil and the higher the WFPS of the soil after rewetting, the larger the hot moment, with an exponential increase once the soil is anaerobic. Substrate availability and fertiliser quantity and type were also important controls on the amount of N2O emitted during the hot moment (p= < 0.0001). However, controls with a constant WFPS can have the same anaerobicity and substrate concentrations, yet much lower emissions, so we suggest that it is the bioavailability of and how the substrates are utilized by the microbial community, and thus how they are primed by the drought, that is the main causal mechanism. Unfortunately, there is still a large uncertainty regarding how microbial population structure, relative gene abundances and gene expression profiles change according to antecedent dry/wet cycles. We suggest several areas of improvement for future studies and the development of drought-impact curves. These would show the relationship between N2O emissions and the length of drought (we found no studies that have investigated this) and N2O emissions and the severity of drought (e.g. the difference between 20% and 40% WFPS). Highlights We investigated the main causal mechanisms of N2O hot moments after soil is rewetted. This is the first meta-analysis and synthesis of the literature regarding N2O hot moments.

However, the effects of different irrigation management practices, such as flood irrigations versus reduced volume methods, including drip and sprinkler irrigation, on GHG emissions are still poorly understood. Therefore, this review was performed to investigate the effects of different irrigation management strategies on the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) by synthesizing existing research that either directly or indirectly examined the effects of at least two irrigation rates on GHG emissions within a single field-based study. Out of thirty-two articles selected for review, reduced irrigation was found to be effective in lowering the rate of CH4 emissions, while flood irrigation had the highest CH4 emission. The rate of CO2 emission increased mostly under low irrigation, and the effect of irrigation strategies on N2O emissions were inconsistent, though a majority of studies reported low N2O emissions in continuously flooded field treatments. The global warming potential (GWP) demonstrated that reduced or water-saving irrigation strategies have the potential to decrease the effect of GHG emissions. In general, GWP was higher for the field that was continuously flooded. The major finding from this review is that optimizing irrigation may help to reduce CH4 emissions and net GWP. However, more field research assessing the effect of varying rates of irrigation on the emission of GHGs from the agricultural field is warranted.","Soil Systems","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems4020020' target='_blank'>10.3390/soilsystems4020020</a>","GHG; nitrous oxide; methane; carbon dioxide; deficit irrigation; reduced irrigation; redox","What is the effect of irrigation treatment and rate on greenhouse gas emissions?",2,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Elevated CO2 (E), nitrogen addition (N), warming (W), irrigation (I) and their combinations (EN, EW, NW, ENW, IE, IN, IW, IEN, INW and IENW) significantly increased AGB. However only half of the treatments (i.e., E, N, W, EN, EW, NW, IE and IW) stimulated BGB, leading to significant declines of root/shoot in treatments with I and/or N.

A meta-analysis of 1,270 observations from 134 publications indicated that elevated temperature decreased soil microbial biomass N and increased N mineralization rates, both in the presence and absence of plants. These findings infer that elevated temperature drives microbially mediated N cycling processes from dominance by anabolic to catabolic reaction processes. Elevated temperature increased soil nitrification and denitrification rates, leading to an increase in N2O emissions of up to 227%, whether plants were present or not. Rates of N mineralization, denitrification and N2O emission demonstrated significant positive relationships with rates of CO(2)emissions under elevated temperatures, suggesting that microbial N cycling processes were associated with enhanced microbial carbon (C) metabolism due to soil warming.

126397,"Effects of water level alteration on carbon cycling in peatlands","Zhong, Y. H.; Jiang, M.; Middleton, B. A.",2020,"Globally, peatlands play an important role in the carbon (C) cycle. High water level is a key factor in maintaining C storage in peatlands, but water levels are vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. This review examines literature related to the effects of water level alteration on C cycling in peatlands to summarize new ideas and uncertainties emerging in this field. Peatland ecosystems maintain their function by altering plant community structure to adapt to changing water levels. Regarding primary production, woody plants are more productive in unflooded, well-aerated conditions, whileSphagnummosses are more productive in wetter conditions. The responses of sedges to water level alteration are species-specific. While peat decomposition is faster in unflooded, well aerated conditions, increased plant production may counteract the C loss induced by increased ecosystem respiration (ER) for a period of time. In contrast, rising water table maintains anaerobic conditions and enhances the role of the peatland as a C sink. Nevertheless, changes in DOC flux during water level fluctuation is complicated and depends on the interactions of flooding with environment. Notably, vegetation also plays a role in C flux but particular species vary in their ability to sequester and transport C. Bog ecosystems have a greater resilience to water level alteration than fens, due to differences in biogeochemical responses to hydrology. The full understanding of the role of peatlands in global C cycling deserves much more study due to uncertainties of vegetation feedbacks, peat-water interactions, microbial mediation of vegetation, wildfire, and functional responses after hydrologic restoration.","Ecosystem Health and Sustainability","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20964129.2020.1806113' target='_blank'>10.1080/20964129.2020.1806113</a>",,"What are the impacts of natural and artificial water level alteration on carbon cycling in peatlands?",2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Previous analyses of LUC impacts on soil C have focused on biophysical variables, leaving aside the influence of socioeconomics. The aim of our study was to determine global soil organic carbon (SOC) change patterns after LUC and to assess the impacts of both biophysical and socioeconomic factors that influence stocks of SOC after LUC simultaneously. This was done at a global scale using 817 sites from 99 peer-reviewed publications. We performed separate analyses for cases in which there were gains and losses of SOC. The best predictors of SOC stock changes were the type of LUC and predictors related to sampling depth, climate, biome, soil order, relief, geology, years since LUC, and primary productivity. However, also, socioeconomic variables such as indices of poverty, population growth, and levels of corruption were important. They explained 33% of the variability in SOC on their own and helped improve model accuracy from 42 to 53% when considered in combination with biophysical variables. SOC losses were highly correlated to the type of LUC and social variables, while SOC gains correlated most strongly with years since LUC and the biophysical variables. The analyses confirm that one of the biggest drivers of SOC loss is conversion to agroindustrial scale cropping, whereas with regard to the recuperation of SOC after LUC, the factor 'time since conversion' emerged as the most important predictive variable, which must be better integrated in respective policy expectations. We conclude that policies should more than ever incentivize holistic approaches that prevent additional loss of native SOC, while at the same time promoting sustainable intensification of existing agricultural regions. Finally future investments on LUC to regain SOC should be aligned with efforts to alleviate poverty and corruption for their potential to achieve mutual gains in soil fertility and socio-economic parameters.","Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-020-09926-1' target='_blank'>10.1007/s11027-020-09926-1</a>",,"What is the effect of land use change on soil organic carbon stocks?",2,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

In addition, study type, plant functional traits, and climate were consistent moderators. These results indicate that warming, elevated CO2, and changed precipitation regime have significantly affected litter decomposition, but the direction and magnitude of the effects of different factors varied, and were also differently mediated by moderator variables. Conclusions: Global cycles of carbon and nutrients via the litter decomposition process can be substantially affected by global change. However, the combined effects of these global change factors on litter decomposition and the different effects between the arid and humid areas cannot be addressed due to the lack of data, indicating the need of more focus on multi-factor manipulative experiments in a wider range of study sites. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Plant and Soil","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-020-04675-1' target='_blank'>10.1007/s11104-020-04675-1</a>","Carbon cycle; Decomposition; Global change; Meta-analysis; Systematic review","What is the impact of climate change on leaf litter decomposition rates?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Thus, the objectives of this study were to identify the responses of SOC storage and sequestration rates to RR in China's croplands. Based on a national meta-analysis of 365 comparisons from 99 publications, the results indicated that RR increased SOC storage by 11.3% compared to residue removal (p &lt; 0.05). Theoretically, when combined with low nitrogen fertilizer input rates (0-120 kg N ha-1), single cropping system, paddy-upland rotation, lower mean annual precipitation (0-500 mm), alkaline soils (pH 7.5-8.5), other methods of RR (including residue chopping, evenly incorporating, and burying) or long-term use (&gt;10 yrs), an increase in SOC storage under RR by 11.6-15.5% could be obtained. The SOC sequestration rate of RR varied from 0.48 (Central China) to 1.61 (Southwest China) Mg C ha-1 yr-1, with a national average value of 0.93 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. Higher SOC sequestration rates enhanced crop production. However, decreases in SOC sequestration rate were observed with increases in experimental durations. The phenomenon of 'C saturation' occurred after 23 yrs of RR. Overall, RR can be used as an efficient and environmentally friendly and climate-smart management practice for long-term use. © 2020 by the authors.",Agronomy,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10050691' target='_blank'>10.3390/agronomy10050691</a>","Meta-analysis; Residue returning; SOC sequestration rate; SOC storage","What are the effects of residue returning on soil organic carbon storage and sequestration rate in China’s croplands?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,3,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"

However, the effects of minimum tillage, coupled with crop residue retention (including no–tillage plus residue retention, NTR, and reduced tillage plus residue retention, RTR), on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock have not been systematically analyzed. Using a dataset consisting of 1928 pairs of data points from 243 studies, we conducted a global meta–analysis to evaluate the effects of crop residue retention and minimum tillage on SOC stock in the 0–30 cm soil and how these effects varied with soil (soil sampling depth and texture), environmental (climate) and crop management conditions (cropping intensity), as well as treatment duration. We found that regardless of the climatic condition, crop management, or residue retention, minimum tillage alone increased the overall mean SOC stock. Specifically, NT and RT increased SOC stock by 11 and 6%, respectively, in comparison to conventional tillage (CT). Compared with CT, NTR and RTR increased SOC stock by 13 and 12%, respectively. The above effects were greater in the topsoil (62% of data points from the 0–15 cm depth) than in the subsoil (38% of data points from the 15–30 cm depth). Moreover, residue retention enhanced the resistance of SOC turnover to agricultural and environmental factors; mean annual temperature (coefficient = 0.15), soil pH (0.14), and experimental duration (0.08) were critical for increasing SOC stock with minimum tillage alone, while the response ratio of SOC stock under coupled residue retention and minimum tillage was insensitive to changes in those factors. Additionally, double cropping generally increased SOC stock cross all conservation tillage practices compared to multiple cropping. Therefore, we conclude that minimum tillage coupled with residue retention in a double-cropping system is the most promising management system for increasing SOC stocks in the 0–30 cm soil in croplands Our finding can inform sustainable soil management practices aimed at increasing resistance of SOC in croplands to climate change and soils degradation induced by intensive agriculture. © 2020","Science of the Total Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140147' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140147</a>",,"What is the effect of crop residue retention on soil carbon accumulation in minimum tillage systems?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

However, the effects of GCFs on microbial diversity is unclear despite that soil microorganisms play a critical role in biogeochemical cycling. Here, we synthesize 1235 GCF observations worldwide and show that microbial rare species are more sensitive to GCFs than common species, while GCFs do not always lead to a reduction in microbial diversity. GCFs-induced shifts in microbial alpha diversity can be predominately explained by the changed soil pH. In addition, GCF impacts on soil functionality are explained by microbial community structure and biomass rather than the alpha diversity. Altogether, our findings of GCF impacts on microbial diversity are fundamentally different from previous knowledge for well-studied plant and animal communities, and are crucial to policy-making for the conservation of microbial diversity hotspots under global changes.

O.; Lu Xixi",2020,"Afforestation contributes to soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and the restoration of degraded soil. However, the changes in SOC stock following afforestation on sloping land are poorly understood. Here we conduct a quantitative review that synthesizes 239 observations from 31 studies to evaluate the effects of slope gradients on the changes in SOC stock in three soil layers (0-20 cm, 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm) following afforestation, considering previous land cover (cropland and grassland) and tree type (broadleaf and conifer). In the topsoil layer, slope gradient has a significant effect on the changes in SOC stock: slope gradient positively relates to SOC stock change and significantly predicts the SOC stock change after controlling for temperature, precipitation, stand age, and initial SOC stock. Soil gradient explains 12.5% of the variance. We find a significant decrease in SOC stock after the afforestation of gentle slopes with a gradient lower than 10% but a significant increase in SOC stock on slopes with a gradient higher than 30%. Afforestation on sloping cropland results in an increase in SOC stock, especially in the upper soil, while afforestation on grassland results in an increase in SOC stocks only on very steep slopes (gradient &gt;60%). Tree type has a limited effect on changes in SOC after afforestation on sloping land. However, conifers show a greater SOC sequestration potential in deeper soils and on steep slopes with a gradient higher than 60%, while broadleaf trees sequester more SOC in topsoil and on slopes with a gradient of 30-60%. The present study suggests that to increase SOC sequestration, priority should be given to afforestation with conifers on steep cropland.","Ecological Engineering","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.105860' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.105860</a>",,"What is the effect of afforestation on soil carbon stocks on sloping land?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,3,"Evidence Review"

Methods We conducted a meta-analysis based on 21 publications to assess the effects of different afforestation modes as well as controlling factors of SOC stocks on the Loess Plateau of China. Results Compared with monoculture plantations, mixed-species plantations could significantly increase the response size of SOC stocks by 28%. For different species combinations, tree-shrub mixtures were more conducive to increasing the SOC stocks. In climate-limited regions (MAT <8 degrees C, MAP <500 mm), the response size of SOC stocks of mixed-species plantations was 34% higher than that of monoculture plantations. Furthermore, significant differences were found in the response size of SOC stocks at young (< 10 yr) and mature stages (> 20 yr). Compared with abandoned land, afforestation on cropland, especially mixed-species plantations, could increase the SOC stocks by 10%. Additionally, compared with monoculture plantations, a stronger coupling relationship was observed between the soil total nitrogen (STN) and SOC stocks in mixed-species plantations.

By synthesizing 1,845 measurements from 164 peer-reviewed publications, we show that around 1.5 degrees C (1.16-2.01 degrees C) of experimental warming significantly stimulates soil respiration by 12.9%, N2O emissions by 35.2%, CH4 emissions by 23.4% from rice paddies, and by 37.5% from natural wetlands. Rising temperature increases CH4 uptake of upland soils by 13.8%. Warming-enhanced emission of soil CH4 and N2O corresponds to an overall source strength of 1.19, 1.84, and 3.12 Pg CO2-equivalent/year under 1 degrees C, 1.5 degrees C, and 2 degrees C warming scenarios, respectively, interacting with soil C loss of 1.60 Pg CO2/year in terms of contribution to climate change. The warming-induced rise in soil CH4 and N2O emissions (1.84 Pg CO2-equivalent/year) could reduce mitigation potential of terrestrial net ecosystem production by 8.3% (NEP, 22.25 Pg CO2/year) under warming. Soil respiration and CH4 release are intensified following the mean warming threshold of 1.5 degrees C scenario, as compared to soil CH4 uptake and N2O release with a reduced and less positive response, respectively. Soil C loss increases to a larger extent under soil warming than under canopy air warming. Warming-raised emission of soil GHG increases with the intensity of temperature rise but decreases with the extension of experimental duration.

We reviewed the literature and developed a map of studies focused on how the three most common types of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal [AM], ectomycorrhizal [EcM], and ericoid mycorrhizal [ErM] fungi) respond to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO2), climatic warming, and changes in the distribution of precipitation. Broadly, we ask how do mycorrhizal fungi respond to climate change, how do these responses vary by fungal type, and how do mycorrhizal traits influence plant adaptation, movement, or extinction in response to climatic change? First, we found that 92% of studies were conducted in the northern hemisphere, and plant host, ecosystem type and study location were only correlated with each other in the northern hemisphere because studies across all mycorrhizal fungal types were only common in the northern hemisphere. Second, we show that temperature and rainfall variability had more variable effects than eCO2 on mycorrhizal fungal structures, but these effects were context dependent. Third, while mycorrhizal fungal types vary in their responses to climate change, it appears that warming leads to more variable responses in ectomycorrhizal than in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Finally, we discuss common traits of mycorrhizal fungi that could aid in fungal and plant adaption to climate change. We posit that mycorrhizal fungi can buffer plant hosts against extinction risk, they can facilitate or retard the dispersal success of plants moving away from poor environments, and, by buffering host plants, they can enable host plant adaptation to new climates. All of these influences are, however, context dependent a finding that reflects the complex traits of mycorrhizal fungi as a group, the diversity of plant species they associate with and the variation in ecosystems in which they reside.

The overall SL (12.34 +/- 2.25 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and SOCL (21.80 +/- 0.91 g C m(-2) year(-1)) suggests substantial losses of the fertile topsoil globally. Grasslands (4.19 +/- 1.22 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) had 77%, 66%, and 41% lower SL than orchards, croplands, and forests, respectively, which is attributable to higher soil organic matter and surface cover.

However, the in-situ effects of manure application on soil N2O emission from field trials (i.e. real-world conditions) and related mechanisms are poorly understood at the global scale. Here, we performed a meta-analysis using 262 field observations from 44 publications to assess the in-situ effects of manure application on soil N2O emission and factors regulating N2O emission (e.g., agricultural practices, manure characteristics and initial soil properties). Our analysis found that manure application significantly increased soil N2O emission in field trials. The largest N2O emissions were observed in soils from warm temperate climates, planted with upland non-leguminous crops and using raw manure. Notably, water-filled pore space (WFPS) significantly affected N2O emission; soils with 50–90% WFPS had the highest N2O emissions. Initial soil properties (e.g. pH, texture and organic carbon (C)) were generally not significant for predicting N2O emission, possibly due to changes in soil properties induced by manure additions. Manures with carbon: nitrogen ratios (C:N) of 10–15 and C contents of 100–300 g C kg−1 produced the lowest N2O emission. The net N2O emission factor (1.13%) resulting from manure application was similar to additions of synthetic N fertilizer (1.25%) and crop residues (1.06%), suggesting that manure application resulted in a similar N2O emission to other soil amendments.

This context is especially important in Brazil, which is responsible for a significant share of the food produced in the world. To assess the impact of the use of nitrogen fertilisers, we conducted a structured review of Brazilian studies on the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O; 11 studies) and ammonia volatilisation (NH3; 13 studies) from nitrogen fertiliser application.

When combining all N addition levels, soil CH4 uptake was insignificantly decreased by 7% in boreal forests, while N addition significantly decreased soil CH4 uptake by 39% in temperate forests and by 21% in subtropical and tropical forests, respectively. Meta-regression analyses, however, indicated a shift from a positive to a negative effect on soil CH4 uptake with increasing N additions both in boreal forests (threshold = 48 kg N ha−1 yr−1) and temperate forests (threshold = 27 kg N ha−1 yr−1), while no such shift was found in subtropical and tropical forests.

L.; Ben-Ari, T.",2020,"Climate change is known to impact crop yields, mainly through increased temperatures, changing rainfall patterns and increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Although the potential effects of each of these factors have been discussed in a number of separate studies, no recent synthesis has been published to provide quantitative estimates of climate change impacts on crop yields, with or without adaptation strategies. In this paper, we synthetize a broad range of experimental or modeling studies to estimate, at the global scale, crop yield changes resulting from the marginal and combined effects of temperature, CO2 concentration and precipitation, with and without adaptation strategies. Crop yield sensitivities are estimated by distinguishing between C3 and C4 crops. For C3 crops, our results show that the positive effects of adaptation (+7.25 %) and CO2 (+9% for +100 ppm) are high enough to offset the negative effects of temperature increase (-2.4 % for +1 °C), even at +4 °C. On the other hand, for maize (i.e., the only C4 plant species in our database) the somewhat low positive effect from increased CO2 concentration and the absence of a significant effect of adaptation lead to higher yield losses, in the order of -10 % for +4 °C. The minimum level of CO2 concentration increase requested to achieve a yield gain under increased temperature conditions is much higher for maize than for C3 crops, in particular for wheat. The estimated effects of adaptation are uncertain, especially for soybean and rice, but also for maize, where the absence of a significant adaptation effect is probably at least partly due to limited data availability.

126249,"A meta-analysis of economic and environmental benefits of conservation agriculture in South Asia","Kiran Kumara, T.M.; Kandpal, A.; Pal, S.",2020,"Agriculture plays a key role in ensuring food and livelihood security in South Asia. However, this region is vulnerable to climate change which is likely to impact the livelihoods of millions of marginal and small holders. Agriculture is not only impacted by climate change but also one of the major contributor to global warming in South Asia. As compared to the traditional practices, Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices help mitigate the impact of climate change through a reduction in carbon emission and conservation of natural resources. In this article, a meta-analysis of the important studies was done for the impact of CA on carbon sequestration, water use, greenhouse gas emissions and cost and net returns. Carbon sequestration potential was found significantly higher in the CA practices (+16.30%) as compared to the conventional tillage. Inclusion of legumes, clay-rich soils, irrigation and presence of soil cover are the major drivers for higher carbon sequestration potential in the region. Additionally, a significant amount of water was also saved as CA practices led to relatively less consumption of water over the conventional tillage. Further, the adoption of CA based management practices resulted in a substantial reduction of CO2 (−4.28%) and CH4 (−25.67%) emissions both in aerobic and anaerobic soil conditions. However, the emission of NO2 and N2O–N gases were higher under the CA, +14.45 and + 5.20% respectively. Nevertheless, the emission of N2O–N was lesser in CA (−1.78%) under aerobic conditions whereas it is increased under anaerobic soil conditions (+12.15%). The adoption of CA practices resulted in higher returns and lower costs as compared to the conventional system. Although CA has significant environmental benefits, the study suggests judicious use of inorganic inputs under CA for managing the impact of climate change in South Asia. Therefore, CA is a sustainable agricultural practice that deserves outscaling in South Asia for mitigation and adaptation of climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Journal of Environmental Management","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110773' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110773</a>",,"What is the effect of conservation agricultural practices compared to conventional tillage on south asian agricultural land carbon sequestation, water use and greenhouse gas emissions?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"

The Tibetan Plateau is sensitive to global change and plays an important role in global carbon cycle due to its large area and high carbon density. Although a large number of field manipulative warming experiments have been conducted on the Tibetan Plateau, the general patterns of how warming affects ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles remain unclear. Here we conducted a meta-analysis from 65 publications to synthesize the responses of C and N cycles to warming in the alpine grassland ecosystems across the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that warming significantly increased aboveground (mean 11.0%, 95% CI 1.6–21.4%) and belowground plant biomass (24.3%, 13.7–36.0%), soil dissolved organic C (13.6%, 5.4–22.5%), soil respiration (14.3%, 2.9–27.1%), ecosystem respiration (15.3%, 4.7–27.1%), and soil ammonium N (29.0%, 4.6–59.2%), but did not change soil total organic C (2.4%, −4.4 to 9.7%), soil total N (1.9%, −2.7 to 6.7%), microbial biomass C (5.5%, −4.1 to 16.2%) and microbial biomass N (4.7%, −7.4 to 18.4%). There were negative relationships between the response ratio of aboveground (P = 0.08, R2 = 0.05) and particularly belowground (P < 0.01, R2 = 0.23) biomass and the duration of warming. Moreover, the effect of warming on ecosystem respiration was positively correlated with the change in soil water content after warming (P = 0.03, R2 = 0.12). Overall, this study showed that ecosystem C and N cycles were generally stimulated by warming, but soil C and N stocks showed minimal responses to warming in the alpine grassland ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau. This finding suggests that the faster ecosystem C and N cycles under climate warming may not necessarily lead to the loss of soil C and N stocks in the alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau.

However, contradictory findings generated by on-site experiments make it necessary to perform a comprehensive assessment of interactions between cover crops, environmental and management factors, and changes in SOC. In this study, we collected data from studies that compared agricultural production with and without cover crops, and then analyzed those data using meta-analysis and regression. Our results showed that including cover crops into rotations significantly increased SOC, with an overall mean change of 15.5% (95% confidence interval of 13.8%–17.3%). Whereas medium-textured soils had highest SOC stocks (overall means of 39 Mg ha−1 with and 37 Mg ha−1 without cover crops), fine-textured soils showed the greatest increase in SOC after the inclusion of cover crops (mean change of 39.5%). Coarse-textured (11.4%) and medium-textured soils (10.3%) had comparatively smaller changes in SOC, while soils in temperate climates had greater changes (18.7%) than those in tropical climates (7.2%). Cover crop mixtures resulted in greater increases in SOC compared to mono-species cover crops, and using legumes caused greater SOC increases than grass species. Cover crop biomass positively affected SOC changes while carbon:nitrogen ratio of cover crop biomass was negatively correlated with SOC changes. Cover cropping was associated with significant SOC increases in shallow soils (≤30 cm), but not in subsurface soils (&gt;30 cm). The regression analysis revealed that SOC changes from cover cropping correlated with improvements in soil quality, specifically decreased runoff and erosion and increased mineralizable carbon, mineralizable nitrogen, and soil nitrogen. Soil carbon change was also affected by annual temperature, number of years after start of cover crop usage, latitude, and initial SOC concentrations. Finally, the mean rate of carbon sequestration from cover cropping across all studies was 0.56 Mg ha−1 yr−1. If 15% of current global cropland were to adopt cover crops, this value would translate to 0.16 ± 0.06 Pg of carbon sequestered per year, which is ~1–2% of current fossil fuels emissions. Altogether, these results indicated that the inclusion of cover crops into agricultural rotations can enhance soil carbon concentrations, improve many soil quality parameters, and serve as a potential sink for atmosphere CO2. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.107735' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.107735</a>",,"What is the effect of cover cropping on soil organic carbon in agricultural rotations?",3,1,2,3,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,3,"Evidence Review"

Although many studies have been conducted on this topic, we still have little understanding of how N deposition affects soil C pools and GHG budgets at the global scale. We synthesized a comprehensive dataset of 275 sites from multiple terrestrial ecosystems around the world and quantified the responses of the global soil C pool and GHG fluxes induced by N enrichment. The results showed that the soil organic C concentration and the soil CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions increased by an average of 3.7%, 0.3%, 24.3% and 91.3% under N enrichment, respectively, and that the soil CH4 uptake decreased by 6.0%. Furthermore, the percentage increase in N2O emissions (91.3%) was two times lower than that (215%) reported by Liu and Greaver (Ecology Letters, 2009, 12:1103-1117). There was also greater stimulation of soil C pools (15.70 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) per kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) than previously reported under N deposition globally. The global N deposition results showed that croplands were the largest GHG sources (calculated as CO2 equivalents), followed by wetlands. However, forests and grasslands were two important GHG sinks. Globally, N deposition increased the terrestrial soil C sink by 6.34 Pg CO2/year. It also increased net soil GHG emissions by 10.20 Pg CO2-Geq (CO2 equivalents)/year. Therefore, N deposition not only increased the size of the soil C pool but also increased global GHG emissions, as calculated by the global warming potential approach.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14970' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.14970</a>",,"What is the effect of nitrogen enrichment on soil carbon pools and soil greenhouse gas fluxes?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

We conducted an extensive literature review and random effect meta-analysis (using REML) of results to identify key relationships between multiple potential independent factors and global N2O emissions factors (EFs) from urine patches. Mean air temperature, soil pH and ruminant animal species (sheep or cow) were significant factors influencing the EFs reviewed. However, several factors that are known to influence N2O emissions, such as animal diet and urine composition, could not be considered due to the lack of reported data. The review highlighted a widespread tendency for inadequate metadata and uncertainty reporting in the published studies, as well as the limited geographical extent of investigations, which are more often conducted in temperate regions thus far. Therefore, here we give recommendations for factors that are likely to affect the EFs and should be included in all future studies, these include the following: soil pH and texture; experimental set-up; direct measurement of soil moisture and temperature during the study period; amount and composition of urine applied; animal type and diet; N2O emissions with a measure of uncertainty; data from a control with zero-N application and meteorological data.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15012' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.15012</a>",,"What is the effect of multiple potential independent factors on the nitrous oxide emission factors from urine patches?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,2,2,3,"Evidence Review"

Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis based on 919 multifactor observations from 120 published studies to examine the interactive effects on NPP of global change factors including elevated [CO2], warming, nitrogen addition, irrigation, drought and changes in species diversity. On average, of the factors studied, six pairs of factors had additive and two pairs had synergistic interactions. Importantly, some of those interaction types changed over time and with treatment intensity. The synergistic interaction between elevated [CO2] and nitrogen addition became additive at high nitrogen addition rates, whereas the synergistic interaction between irrigation and warming diminished at higher temperatures. Over time, the additive effect between elevated [CO2] and increased species richness switched to synergistic. Other global change factor pairs-including elevated [CO2] and warming, nitrogen addition and increased richness, irrigation and N addition, as well as drought and increased richness-remained additive regardless of their treatment intensity or experimental duration. Interaction types of those global change factor pairs did not vary with ecosystem types assessed in our study. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the assumptions of static effects through time or ignoring treatment intensity effects will provide inaccurate predictions of the interactive effects of global change factors on terrestrial NPP.

T.",2020,"Southern Ocean waters are among the most vulnerable to ocean acidification. The projected increase in the CO2 level will cause changes in carbonate chemistry that are likely to be damaging to organisms inhabiting these waters. A meta-analysis was undertaken to examine the vulnerability of Antarctic marine biota occupying waters south of 60°S to ocean acidification. This meta-analysis showed that ocean acidification negatively affects autotrophic organisms, mainly phytoplankton, at CO2 levels above 1,000 μatm and invertebrates above 1,500 μatm, but positively affects bacterial abundance. The sensitivity of phytoplankton to ocean acidification was influenced by the experimental procedure used. Natural, mixed communities were more sensitive than single species in culture and showed a decline in chlorophyll a concentration, productivity, and photosynthetic health, as well as a shift in community composition at CO2 levels above 1,000 μatm. Invertebrates showed reduced fertilization rates and increased occurrence of larval abnormalities, as well as decreased calcification rates and increased shell dissolution with any increase in CO2 level above 1,500 μatm. Assessment of the vulnerability of fish and macroalgae to ocean acidification was limited by the number of studies available. Overall, this analysis indicates that many marine organisms in the Southern Ocean are likely to be susceptible to ocean acidification and thereby likely to change their contribution to ecosystem services in the future.

This study presents a meta-analysis of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ammonia (NH3) emissions from four main dairy manure composting methods (static, turning, windrow and silo) based on 41 scientific articles (153 treatments). Gaseous emissions and secondary variables such as average composting temperature, initial moisture content, initial total carbon (TC) and initial total nitrogen (TN) content from each compost treatment were extracted and normalised to enable inter-study comparison. Six mitigation measures for composting were selected and mitigation efficiency (Em) of each measure on different gas emissions were calculated. Gaseous emissions from different composting methods showed large differences. Turning composting resulted in larger carbon and nitrogen losses compared to other composting methods. Although silo composting significantly promoted NH3 emission, it reduced GHG losses by 82.84% compared with turning composting. Principal component analysis showed that the initial TC and TN content of the composted material were crucial in mediating gaseous emissions. Low TC and TN content can simultaneously reduce CH4, CO2 and N2O emissions. Applying compost biofilters was the most effective way to reduce NH3 emission with ME value of −97%. Adding sawdust or straw could reduce CH4 and N2O emissions by 66.3% and 44.0% respectively.

However, the impacts of these practices on SOC and crop yields are variable over the long-term duration, and an improved understanding of the factors influencing SOC sequestration and sustainable productivity is still needed to provide evidence-based management decisions. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of long-term (≥10 years) application of different fertilizer management practices adapted across China on crop productivity, yield sustainability, and SOC sequestration. Results indicated that unbalanced mineral fertilizer (UMF), balanced mineral fertilizer (BMF), organic fertilizers (OF), combined unbalanced mineral and OF, and combined balanced mineral and organic fertilizers (BMOF) significantly enhanced the grain yield, and SOC sequestration compared with control (p <.05). For UMF, the increases in SOC and grain yields were least among fertilization practices. Comparing OF, BMF mostly produced more grain yields, but with a slight increase in C sequestration. Highest SOC sequestration rate of 0.43 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 was recorded in BMOF, among all the treatments. The data obtained indicated that SOC sequestration is highly time-dependent. Irrespective of fertilization mode, SOC gradually increased and attained the peak of sequestration rate in the initial two decades rather than at later stages of fertilizer addition. The linear fitted model indicated that an increase in SOC sequestration benefits sustainable productivity.

Here, we examine the isolated and combined effects of warming, acidification, and reductions in phytoplankton and predator abundances in a series of factorial experiments. We find that warming directly impacts the top of the food web, but that the intermediate trophic groups are more strongly influenced by indirect effects mediated by altered top-down interactions. Direct manipulations of predator and phytoplankton abundance reveal similar strong top-down interactions following top predator decline. A meta-analysis of published experiments further supports the conclusion that warming has stronger direct impacts on the top and bottom of the food web rather than the intermediate trophic groups, with important differences between freshwater and marine plankton communities.

However, even within the Caribbean, experimental acidification and warming studies reveal a wide array of coral calcification responses across reef systems and among species, complicating efforts to predict how corals will respond to these global-scale stressors. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the calcification responses of Caribbean corals to experimentally induced seawater ocean acidification, ocean warming, and the combination of both stressors. Calcification rates were reduced for corals reared under warming alone, but acidification and the combination of both stressors did not clearly reduce calcification rates. Calcification responses of corals collected from the Florida Keys and Belize were compared for regional differences since a greater number of studies were performed on corals collected from these two regions. Notably, corals from the Florida Keys did not exhibit reduced calcification under acidification, warming, or the combination of both stressors, while corals from Belize exhibited reduced calcification under warming alone. Further investigation of these regional trends suggests that the warming and acidification treatments employed dictated calcification responses, rather than collection region. Results from this meta-analysis are constrained by the very few studies that have been conducted within the Caribbean to assess ocean acidification and warming and the large variation in experimental procedure among studies. This meta-analysis reveals existing gaps in our understanding of how corals will likely respond to projected acidification and warming and highlights ways to improve comparability among experimental studies conducted on corals within the same region to better predict coral calcification response under global change.","Frontiers in Marine Science","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.00127' target='_blank'>10.3389/fmars.2020.00127</a>",,"What is the effect of ocean warming/acidification on coral calcification in the Caribbean Sea?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,3,"Evidence Review"

However, the magnitude of changes in GHG emissions from wetlands undergoing various LULCC types remains unclear. We conducted a global meta-analysis with a database of 209 sites to examine the effects of LULCC types of constructed wetlands (CWs), croplands (CLs), aquaculture ponds (APs), drained wetlands (DWs), and pastures (PASs) on the variability in CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the natural coastal wetlands, riparian wetlands, and peatlands. Our results showed that the natural wetlands were net sinks of atmospheric CO2 and net sources of CH4 and N2O, exhibiting the capacity to mitigate greenhouse effects due to negative comprehensive global warming potentials (GWPs; -0.9 to -8.7 t CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1)). Relative to the natural wetlands, all LULCC types (except CWs from coastal wetlands) decreased the net CO2 uptake by 69.7%-456.6%, due to a higher increase in ecosystem respiration relative to slight changes in gross primary production. The CWs and APs significantly increased the CH4 emissions compared to those of the coastal wetlands. All LULCC types associated with the riparian wetlands significantly decreased the CH4 emissions. When the peatlands were converted to the PASs, the CH4 emissions significantly increased. The CLs, as well as DWs from peatlands, significantly increased the N2O emissions in the natural wetlands. As a result, all LULCC types (except PASs from riparian wetlands) led to remarkably higher GWPs by 65.4%-2,948.8%, compared to those of the natural wetlands. The variability in GHG fluxes with LULCC was mainly sensitive to changes in soil water content, water table, salinity, soil nitrogen content, soil pH, and bulk density. This study highlights the significant role of LULCC in increasing comprehensive GHG emissions from global natural wetlands, and our results are useful for improving future models and manipulative experiments.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14933' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.14933</a>",,"What are the effects of land-use and land-cover change on greenhouse gas emissions in natural wetland ecosystems?",2,1,2,2,2,1,2,2,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

To reveal the general response patterns and controlling factors of various extracellular enzyme activities (EEA), we collected data from 78 peer-reviewed papers to investigate the responses of extracellular enzyme activities (EEA), including beta-1.4-glucosidase (BG),beta-D-cellobiosidase (CBH), beta-1,4-xylosidase (XYL), leudne amino peptidase (LAP), N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), urease (URE), phosphatase (PHO), peroxidase (PER), phenol oxidase (PDX), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), to experimental warming. Our results showed that warming treatments increased soil temperature by 1.9 degrees C on average. The oxidative EEA, calculated as the sum of PER, PDX and PPO, was on average stimulated by 9.4% under warming. However, the responses of C acquisition EEA (the sum of BG. CBH and XYL), N acquisition ELA (the sum of LAP, NAG and URE), and P acquisition ELA to warming had large variations across studies. The warming effects on C. N. P acquisition EEA and oxidative EEA tended to increase with soil warming magnitude and duration as well as the mean annual temperature. The response of C acquisition EEA to warming was positively correlated with fungal biomass, while that of P acquisition LEA had positive relationships with fungi: bacteria ratios. The response of oxidative EEA was negatively correlated with the abundance of gram-positive bacterial biomass. Our results suggested that warming consistently stimulated oxidative LEA, but had diverse effects on hydrolytic LEA, which were dependent on the warming magnitude or duration, or environmental factors. The observed relationships between changes in microbial traits and extracellular enzymes suggested that microbial compositions drive changes in enzyme decomposition under warming.

These alterations can be particularly large in high northern latitude ecosystems, which are experiencing the most intense warming globally. In this meta-analysis, we investigated global trends in how experimental warming is altering the biogeochemistry of the most common limiting nutrient for biological processes in cold ecosystems of high northern latitudes (&gt;50°): nitrogen (N). For comparison, we also analyzed cold ecosystems at intermediate and high southern latitudes. In addition, we examined N-relevant genes and enzymes, and the abundance of belowground organisms. Together, our findings suggest that warming in cold ecosystems increases N mineralization rates and N2O emissions and does not affect N fixation, at least not in a consistent way across biomes and conditions. Changes in belowground N fluxes caused by warming lead to an accumulation of N in the forms of dissolved organic and root N. These changes seem to be more closely linked to increases in enzyme activity that target relatively labile N sources, than to changes in the abundance of N-relevant genes (e.g., amoA and nosZ). Finally, our analysis suggests that warming in cold ecosystems leads to an increase in plant roots, fungi, and (likely in an indirect way) fungivores, and does not affect the abundance of archaea, bacteria, or bacterivores. In summary, our findings highlight global trends in the ways warming is altering the biogeochemistry and ecology of soils in cold ecosystems, and provide information that can be valuable for prediction of changes and for management of such ecosystems. © 2020 The Authors.

This paper aims to present the latest progress and controversies on the studies of the cooling effects of waterbodies, greenspaces, and parks. In order to do this research, international search engines were employed to systematically search peer-reviewed articles, including the cooling effect of blue-green space and threshold-size-based UHI mitigation studies. After that, the inductive analysis is used to analyze the relevant literature. We found that previous studies concentrated on the correlations between different landscape types, temperature variations and the quantification of cooling intensity, etc. However, threshold-size-based research has received less attention, which limits the ability to make specific recommendations for actionable planning and management – usingthe smallest blue-green space for the best cooling effect. The review also revealed the controversies over the effects of blue-green space size, shape, landscape composition and configuration on cooling effect. Besides, we pointed out that the uncertainties (i.e., the optimal proportion of blue-green space in a park) and the reasons of controversial results of the cooling effect need to be further investigated. We also suggested that more attention should be paid to quantify the contributions of local background climate and landscape characteristics to the cooling effect (threshold-size) of blue-green space.

How green roofs can help reduce carbon emissions in urban areas, directly and indirectly, is the focus of this review, which draws on recently published studies. The direct impact of green roofs on carbon sequestration involves vegetation and soil media, which can capture and store air pollutants on a building scale. The indirect impact includes the long-term green roof effect, which can include reducing building energy consumption, leading to a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. Consequently, this process could reduce CO2 emissions around the globe. According to the literature analysis, the indirect long-term benefits help promote green roofs as a green practice around the world. It was found that vegetation and soil properties are the key factors affecting the performance of building energy consumption reduction and CO2 sequestration.

On the other hand, elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO2) can enhance the yield of vegetables that are more nutrient-demanding compared to grain crops. Therefore, it is expected that vegetables would respond in another way to eCO2 and interact with environmental changes differently. In this study, we reviewed the effect of eCO2 on yield and yield components of vegetables by a meta-analysis using 107 selected articles. Elevated CO2 (827 μmol mol−1) increased yield of vegetables as a whole by 34% (n = 8877) but did not affect the dry matter content. Elevated CO2 increased the harvest index by 23% whilst it increased the root to shoot biomass ratio by 8%. The increased vegetable yield was associated with increased vegetable number of the organs largely by 32% and vegetable mass to a lesser extent (11%). The least increases in the mass of fruit vegetables (10%) could be the reason for the least yield improvement (30%, n = 5778) when compared to leafy vegetables, stem vegetables, root vegetables and flower vegetables. In addition, the effect of eCO2 on yield tended to differ between the levels of temperature, light, water and N availability, with the differences being greater than those of salinity, O3 and N form. Drought stress appears to be a major constraint limiting the increases in number and yield of vegetables under eCO2. We conclude that environments have to be optimized to improve the yield benefit from high CO2 for a sustainable vegetable production. In scenarios of high CO2 environment, due to climate change, a “wise use” of atmospheric CO2, without implementing an extra source for CO2 is a good step for a cleaner vegetable production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Journal of Cleaner Production","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119920' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.119920</a>",,"What is the effect of elevated carbon dioxide on vegetable crop yields?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,2,2,3,"Evidence Review"

Thus, numerous studies have examined factors affecting water-use efficiency (WUE, an important indicator of the balance between productivity and water availability), and ways to improve it. However, conflicting results have been obtained and WUE has generally only been improved at the expense of yield. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the impact of water stress on WUE and identify crops and some water management strategies that could potentially increase both productivity and WUE under water stress. Overall, the meta-analysis of 80 peer-reviewed publications, including 792 observations, showed that crop WUE slightly improved under drought stress (LnRR++=0.015), but the results varied depending on crop type and drought treatments. Moreover, the results indicate that both WUE and yield can be improved under drought stress by identifying appropriate crops (potentially including manioc, canola, rose geranium, spearmint, peanut, wheat, pear-jujube, watermelon, tomato, spinach, and pepper) and water management regimes. Short drought duration (&lt;30 days) and deficit irrigation throughout the whole season rather than only during the vegetative or reproductive phase are more likely to improve WUE and yield concurrently. Our study is one of the first to analyze factors affecting WUE variation and identify ways to increase WUE and yield simultaneously under drought stress, based on a large set of data from all over the world.

The impact of global warming on bivalve aquaculture has recently been reviewed. However, the impact of OA on bivalve aquaculture has received relatively less attention. Although there are many reports on the effects of OA on bivalves, this information is poorly organized and the connection between OA and bivalve aquaculture is unclear. Therefore, understanding the potential impact of acidification on ecosystems and bivalve aquaculture is of prime importance. Here, we provide a comprehensive scientific review of the impact of OA on bivalves and propose mitigation measures for future bivalve farming. This information will help to establish aquaculture and fisheries management plans to be implemented in commercial fisheries and nature conservation. In general, scientific evidence suggests that OA threatens bivalves by diminishing the availability of carbonate minerals, which may adversely affect the development of early life stages, calcification, growth, byssus attachment and survival of bivalves. The Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) approach is a useful method in slowing the effects of climate change, thereby providing longer adaptation period for bivalves to changing ocean conditions. However, for certain regions that experience intense OA effects or for certain bivalve species that have much longer generational time, IMTA alone may not be sufficient to protect bivalves from the adverse effects of climate change. Therefore, it is highly recommended to combine IMTA and genetic breeding methods to facilitate transgenerational acclimation or evolution processes to enhance the climate resilience of bivalves.","Science of The Total Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134794' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134794</a>",,"What are the effects of ocean acidification on growth and development of marine bivalves?",2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,"Evidence Review"

A national-scale data analysis in China","Chen, D.; Wei, W.; Daryanto, S.; Tarolli, P.",2020,"Terracing practice is expected to reserve soil organic carbon (SOC) pools, which are the key components for maintaining soil fertility and land productivity. In China such practice is widespread from center to south since ancient time. In this work, to reveal the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of SOC under different terraced sites in China, we conducted a meta-analysis on 78 studies regarding terracing effects on SOC sequestration. The between-group heterogeneity analysis indicated that terracing land use, age, climatic background, and slope gradient were critical factors for SOC sequestration, while terracing structure and soil depth were not. Overall, for China's landscapes, terracing increased SOC sequestration by 32.4% on average. Relative to other terracing structures, level ditches and half-moon terraces receive more rainwater and fertile topsoil from upper slopes due to their specific concave structures. Terracing in those areas with lower temperatures and less precipitation showed higher SOC sequestration. The extent of SOC sequestration due to terracing was primarily determined by land use type. Reforestation terraces could increase SOC sequestration markedly by eliminating water erosion and related soil carbon loss. The terracing aged 1–2 years leads to a decrease of 6.4% averagely on SOC sequestration, likely because the breakdown of soil aggregates through soil excavation and redistribution improves the decomposition of SOC. Furthermore, terracing aged over five years was more effective on SOC sequestration. Since this study offered a useful synthesis on multiple terracing factors affecting soil carbon in China, it can help to provide a wiser utilization and management of terracing to maximize SOC sequestration, and to make better terracing practices in the context of global change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Science of the Total Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137751' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137751</a>",,"How effective are terracing practices for increasing soil organic carbon sequestration in Chinese landscapes?",3,1,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"

Our review and synthesis of the evidence suggests that the impacts of ammonia on biodiversity can be significant, with certain species and habitats, such as bog and peatland, particularly susceptible.

Many of these modifications improve the larvae's ability to swim, which satisfies a suite of crucial biological and ecological functions. Indeed, larval fish swimming performance has been considered a good proxy for overall condition, a predictor for growth and survival, and particularly helpful in assessing effects of natural and anthropogenic stress. Several methodologies have been developed to test larval fish swimming performance; however, measured swimming capabilities can strongly depend on the methodology utilised and developmental stage investigated. The aims of this review were, therefore, to link the ontogenetic development of swimming performance in early life stages of marine fishes, particularly the anatomical and physiological processes around the fins, muscles, and gills, with both the experimental methodologies used and the environmental stressors tested. We conducted a literature search and found 156 research papers relevant to swimming performance of marine teleost fish larvae. We found swimming performance to be highly variable among species and driven by temperature. In a meta-analysis focusing on the impacts of environmental stress on larval swimming performance, we found that prey reduction had the greatest impact on swimming. Methods used to evaluate swimming should keep the ontogenetic stage a focus, as forced swimming experiments are unfit for larvae prior to flexion of the notochord.

L.",2019,"Purpose Climate change continues to garner attention in the public sphere. Most recognize its potential to affect global carbon (C) dynamics in the biosphere. Many posit that global warming promotes the decomposition of soil organic C (SOC) and increases soil C release. However, it remains unclear how soil C dynamics respond to different influencing factors (e.g., warming method, magnitude/duration, mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP)) across ecosystems on a global scale. Materials and methods Here, we performed a meta-analysis to identify the general global patterns of how warming impacts soil C dynamics. Results and discussion Across all terrestrial ecosystems, warming reduced SOC by 4.96% and stimulated soil microbial biomass C (MBC), soil respiration (SR), and heterotrophic respiration (HR) by 6.30, 14.56, and 8.42%, respectively. Warming affected soil C pools in grasslands and soil C fluxes in forests. The changes in SOC did not correlate to warming magnitude/duration or climate factors (MAT and MAP). However, changes in both MBC and SR did correlate to warming magnitude/duration and MAT. The changes in HR showed a quadratic response to warming magnitude and a linear response to MAP. Open-top chamber method can effectively affect soil C pools. SR proved to be more sensitive than HR to most warming methods. Conclusions Our results showed that soil C release exhibited more sensitivity to warming magnitude/duration or MAT/MAP than did net soil C sequestration. These results indicate that warming induces accelerated transition of soils from C sink to C source. Furthermore, they show the potential for global warming effects to exacerbate the positive feedback loop in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the declining rates-of-change in SR and HR under high magnitude warming may mitigate the positive feedback.

Mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrass meadows, referred to as blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), are hotspots of atmospheric CO2 storage due to their capacity to sequester carbon at a far higher rate than terrestrial forests. Despite increased effort to understand the mechanisms underpinning blue carbon fluxes, there has been little synthesis of how management activities influence carbon stocks and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in BCEs. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of 111 studies that measured how carbon stocks and GHG fluxes in BCEs respond to various coastal management strategies. Research effort has focused mainly on restoration approaches, which resulted in significant increases in blue carbon after 4 years compared to degraded sites, and the potential to reach parity with natural sites after 7-17 years. Lesser studied management alternatives, such as sediment manipulation and altered hydrology, showed only increases in biomass and weaker responses for soil carbon stocks and sequestration. The response of GHG emissions to management was complex, with managed sites emitting less than natural reference sites but emitting more compared to degraded sites. Individual GHGs also differed in their responses to management. To date, blue carbon management studies are underrepresented in the southern hemisphere and are usually limited in duration (61% of studies <3 years duration).

Land use change from primary forest to plantation, grassland or agricultural land may lead to profound alteration in the emission of soil greenhouse gases (GHG). Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis concerning the effects of primary forest conversion on soil GHG emissions and explored the potential mechanisms from 101 studies. Our results showed that conversion of primary forest significantly decreased soil CO2 efflux and increased soil CH4 efflux, but had no effect on soil N2O efflux. However, the effect of primary forest conversion on soil GHG emissions was not consistent across different types of land use change. For example, soil CO2 efflux did not respond to the conversion from primary forest to grassland. Soil N2O efflux showed a prominent increase within the initial stage after conversion of primary forest and then decreased over time while the responses of soil CO2 and CH4 effluxes were consistently negative or positive across different elapsed time intervals. Moreover, either within or across all types of primary forest conversion, the response of soil CO2 efflux was mainly moderated by changes in soil microbial biomass carbon and root biomass while the responses of soil N2O and CH4 effluxes were related to the changes in soil nitrate and soil aeration-related factors (soil water content and bulk density), respectively.

Across the data set, temperature increased N2O emissions by 33%. However, the effects were highly variable across biomes, with strongest temperature responses in shrublands, variable responses in forests and negative responses in tundra. The warming methods employed also influenced the effects of temperature on N2O emissions (most effectively induced by open-top chambers). Whole-day or whole-year warming treatment significantly enhanced N2O emissions, but daytime, nighttime or short-season warming did not have significant effects. Regardless of biome, treatment method and season, increased precipitation promoted N2O emission by an average of 55%, while decreased precipitation suppressed N2O emission by 31%, predominantly driven by changes in soil moisture. The effect size of precipitation changes on nirS and nosZ showed a U-shape relationship with soil moisture; further insight into biotic mechanisms underlying N2O emission response to climate change remain limited by data availability, underlying a need for studies that report SFG.

Glacier retreat is a worldwide phenomenon increasing the threat to water resources, biodiversity and associated ecosystem services for hundreds of millions of people, mostly in developing countries. Our understanding of the ecological consequences of glacier retreat has improved significantly in the past decade, but we still lack a comprehensive framework for predicting biodiversity responses to glacier retreat globally, across diverse habitats and taxa. By conducting a global meta-analysis of 234 published studies, including more than 2,100 biodiversity surveys covering marine, freshwater and terrestrial assemblages, we show here that taxon abundance and richness generally increase at lower levels of glacier influence, suggesting that diversity increases locally as glaciers retreat. However, significant response heterogeneity was observed between study sites and species: 6–11% of the studied populations, particularly in fjords, would lose out from glacier retreat.

Temperature manipulative experiments have been conducted to understand the responsive pattern of plant ecophysiology to climatewarming. However, it remains unknown how different methodology used in these experiments will affect plants ecophysiological responses to warming. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of the warming manipulative studies to synthesize the ecophysiological traits responses to warming treatment of different intensities, durations, and conducted for different species and under different experimental settings. The results indicated that warming enhanced leaf dark respiration (R-d) and specific leaf area (SLA) but decreased net photosynthetic rate (A(net)) and leaf nitrogen content (LN). The positive and negative effects of warming on Rd and Anet were greater for C-4 species than C-3 species, respectively. The negative effect of warming treatment on Anet and LN and the positive effect on Rd were more evident under > 1 year warming treatment. Negative effects of warming were more evident for plants grown at < 10 L pots when experiment duration was longer than 1 year. The magnitude of warming treatment had a significant impact on most of the parameters that were investigated in the study. Overall, the results showed that warming effects on plant ecophysiological traits varied among different response variables and PFTs and affected by the magnitude of temperature change and experimental methodology. The results highlight the need for cautiously selecting the values of plant ecophysiological parameters in forecasting ecosystem function changes in future climate regimes and designing controlled experiments to realistically reflecting ecosystems responses to future global warming.","Frontiers in Plant Science","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.00957' target='_blank'>10.3389/fpls.2019.00957</a>",,"What are the effects of global warming of diﬀerent magnitudes and durations on plant ecophysiological traits at leaf level?",3,1,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Although specialty crops compose the majority of the state's crops in both economic value and land area, the portion of GHG emissions contributed by them is still highly uncertain. Current and emerging soil management practices affect the mitigation of those emissions. Herein, we review the scientific literature on the impact of soil management practices in California specialty crop systems on GHG nitrous oxide emissions. As such studies from most major specialty crop systems in California are limited, we focus on two annual and two perennial crops with the most data from the state: tomato, lettuce, wine grapes and almond. Nitrous oxide emission factors were developed and compared to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors, and state-wide emissions for these four crops were calculated for specific soil management practices. Dependent on crop systems and specific management practices, the emission factors developed in this study were either higher, lower or comparable to IPCC emission factors. Uncertainties caused by low gas sampling frequency in these studies were identified and discussed. These uncertainties can be remediated by robust and standardized estimates of nitrous oxide emissions from changes in soil management practices in California specialty crop systems. Promising practices to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and meet crop production goals, pertinent gaps in knowledge on this topic and limitations of this approach are discussed.","Soil Systems","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems3040076' target='_blank'>10.3390/soilsystems3040076</a>",,"What is the effect of different soil management practices on nitrous oxide emissions from areas growing speciality crops (tomatoes, lettuce, wine grapes and almonds) in California?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,1,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Yet, the magnitude and temporal scale of these impacts are largely unknown. We undertook a systematic review to examine the influence of LULCC on mangrove carbon stocks and soil greenhouse gas (GHG) effluxes. A search of 478 data points from the peer-reviewed literature revealed a substantial reduction of biomass (82% +/- 35%) and soil (54% +/- 13%) carbon stocks due to LULCC. The relative loss depended on LULCC type, time since LULCC and geographical and climatic conditions of sites. We also observed that the loss of soil carbon stocks was linked to the decreased soil carbon content and increased soil bulk density over the first 100 cm depth. We found no significant effect of LULCC on soil GHG effluxes. Regeneration efforts (i.e. restoration, rehabilitation and afforestation) led to biomass recovery after similar to 40 years. However, we found no clear patterns of mangrove soil carbon stock re-establishment following biomass recovery. Our findings suggest that regeneration may help restore carbon stocks back to pre-disturbed levels over decadal to century time scales only, with a faster rate for biomass recovery than for soil carbon stocks. Therefore, improved mangrove ecosystem management by preventing further LULCC and promoting rehabilitation is fundamental for effective climate change mitigation policy.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14774' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.14774</a>",,"What are the effects of land‐use and land‐cover change on mangrove blue carbon (soil carbon stock, bulk density, carbon content and carbon dioxide and methane effluxes)?",3,2,4,4,3,3,2,2,3,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

We present a meta-analysis of the potential effects of environmental change on CH4 uptake by forest soils. Such effects have not been reliably estimated even though aerobic methanotrophs in forest soils are the largest biological sink for atmospheric CH4. Differences in the annual rate of CH4 uptake between forests are likely caused by differences in vegetation, microbial communities, and the physical and chemical properties of soil environments, but we found no clear different patterns at annual scale among tropical, temperate, and boreal forests. The meta-analysis indicated that the rates of CH4 uptake in forest ecosystems were significantly decreased under elevated CO2 and N enrichment, but the rates increased under drought. The effects of warming on the rates of CH4 uptake were inconsistent in forest soils, and the response ratio accordingly suggested that a warmer climate would have no significant effect on the rate of CH4 uptake. The seasonality of CH4 uptake in natural forest soils and the clear results of the drought experiments evidence the importance of soil moisture. However, our linear model did not unravel a clear negative effect of climatic water surplus nor mean annual precipitation on soil CH4 uptake.

The CA system can provide multiple ecosystem services such as provisioning, regulating and supporting services. The regulating services include improving carbon status, and physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, which further lead to provisioning services in terms of sustained crop and water productivity. Increased soil carbon sequestration improves supporting services, namely, soil aggregation that increases available soil moisture and can be helpful for better plant growth and development. It also improves soil biodiversity both above-and below-ground. Here we focus on the potential ecosystem service benefits accrued from CA.

To address these gaps, we conducted a review of literature to analyze the potential of technical options in Southeast Asia (SEA). Using screening criteria based on reliability of experimental data, 31 region-specific cases were selected for the analysis. A meta-analysis indicated that water management options, including single and multiple drainage approaches such as alternative wetting and drying (AWD), significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 35% as a mean effect size (95% confidential interval: 41-29%), as well as the combined effects of CH4+N2O (net GWP) by 29% (36-23%).

Application of biochar reduced both CH4 and N2O emissions by 20% (40% to -7%), while significantly increased rice yield by 28% (8-52%). Other options such as removal of rice straw from the previous crop, composting rice straw and manure, application of sulfate-containing fertilizer, and soil drying in the fallow season also have recognized potential to reduce emissions but require further data and consideration of possible trade-offs.

Literature has documented various measures that seek to enhance CS by wetlands and therefore enable these ecosystems remain vital in global carbon (C) balance and climate change mitigation. The objective of this review is to critically analyse these measures with respect to their feasibility and impact on wetland functioning, both in ecological and socio-economic perspectives. In doing this, we strive to address the concerns of wetland scientists, managers and other stakeholders pertaining CS by wetlands. Findings indicate that CS can be enhanced through both non-manipulative and manipulative measures. Non-manipulative measures aim at enhancing CS by increasing wetlands’ spatial extent, while manipulative ones aim at altering characteristics of certain wetland components that influence CS. Their overall target is to increase organic matter input, apportion C to longer-lived pools, and increase residence times of C pools. Based on the identified research gaps, we recommend that CS actions for wetlands should prioritize conservation of existing natural wetlands. Additional measures should consider associated risks such as those on wetland flora and fauna, soil and hydrological regimes, and competing services. We further believe that successful implementation of non-manipulative measures for CS will require attachment of economic incentives that are not only foreseeable, but also adequate to match returns from competing land uses. © 2019, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Earth Systems and Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41748-019-00094-0' target='_blank'>10.1007/s41748-019-00094-0</a>","Carbon dioxide; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Wetlands","How effective are manipulative and non-manipulative approaches to enhance carbon sequestration by wetlands?",2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Transitions between natural and human-managed ecosystems affect biogeochemical cycles in many ways, but soil processes are among the least understood.

Conversion from a natural ecosystem to any anthropogenic land use increased soil CH4 and N2O fluxes by 234 kg CO2-equivalents ha(-1) y(-1), on average. Reversion of managed ecosystems to that resembling natural ecosystems did not fully reverse those effects, even after 80 years. In general, neither the type of ecosystem converted, nor the type of subsequent anthropogenic land use, affected the magnitude of increase in soil emissions. Land-use changes in wetter ecosystems resulted in greater increases in CH4 fluxes, but reduced N2O fluxes. An interacting suite of soil variables influenced CH4 and N2O fluxes, with availability of inorganic nitrogen (that is, extractable ammonium and nitrate), pH, total carbon, and microclimate being strong mediators of effects of land-use change. In addition, time after a change in land use emerged as a critical factor explaining the effects of land-use change-with increased emissions of both greenhouse gases diminishing rapidly after conversion. Further research is needed to elucidate complex biotic and abiotic mechanisms that drive land-use change effects on soil greenhouse gas emissions, but particularly during this initial disturbance when emissions are greatest relative to native vegetation.

However, the effects of substitution of fertilizer by manure on crop yield, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and emissions of ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) as function of soil and manure properties, experimental duration and application strategies have not been quantified systematically and convincingly yet. Here, we present a meta-analysis of these effects using results of 143 published studies in China. Results indicate that the partial substitution of synthetic fertilizers by manure significantly increased the yield by 6.6% and 3.3% for upland crop and paddy rice, respectively, but full substitution significantly decreased yields (by 9.6% and 4.1%). The response of crop yields to manure substitution varied with soil pH and experimental durations, with relatively large positive responses in acidic soils and long-term experiments. NUE increased significantly at a moderate ratio (<40%) of substitution. NH3 emissions were significantly lower with full substitution (62%-77%), but not with partial substitution. Emissions of CH4 from paddy rice significantly increased with substitution ratio (SR), and varied by application rates and manure types, but N2O emissions decreased. The SR did not significantly influence N2O emissions from upland soils, and a relative scarcity of data on certain manure characteristic was found to hamper identification of the mechanisms. We derived overall mean N2O emission factors (EF) of 0.56% and 0.17%, as well as NH3 EFs of 11.1% and 6.5% for the manure N applied to upland and paddy soils, respectively. Our study shows that partial substitution of fertilizer by manure can increase crop yields, and decrease emissions of NH3 and N2O, but depending on site-specific conditions.

Most experiments manipulated single rather than multiple global change drivers in temperate ecosystems of the USA, Europe and China.

A review on key structural factors of green roofs and their effects on urban climate","Susca, T.",2019,"In the next decades, the increase in global population will lead to further urbanization determining, on the one hand, an increase in building energy use and, on the other hand, a surge in urban temperature, which, in turn, affects building energy demand. Since the building sector greatly contributes to the use of energy globally, the amelioration of this sector is an urgent issue to contribute to climate stabilization. Published literature shows that green roofs affect both directly and indirectly building energy use, delivering the message that green roofs are fit-all solutions. However, the efficacy of the deployment of green roofs varies depending on climate and on their specific design. The present study contains a geographically explicit review of the potential building energy benefits deriving by the installation of green roofs depending on their specific design aiming at answering to the following research questions: - Are green roofs fit-all solutions for decreasing building energy use in diverse climates? - How insulation, growing media, and plant selection of green roofs should be calibrated in different climates to maximize their effect on building energy use? - How green roofs can contribute to urban heat island-mitigation in different climates? Answering these research-questions, this study provides urban decision-makers and planning agencies useful insights to, not only prioritize strategies, but also efficiently design by-laws and local regulations to maximize the potential positive effect of urban-wide green roof deployment on building energy use. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building and Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106273' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106273</a>",,"What are the effects of green roof deployment on building energy use and the urban heat-island effect?",3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,"Evidence Review"

Application of natural additives that are suitable for cleaner animal production is a necessity. Yucca schidigera is capable of this and because it could grow in desert area, makes it a potential asset in the face of global warming-related climate changes. Thirty-five studies were used as data, which include in vitro and in vivo evaluations. About 43%, 28.6% and 31% were proportion of ruminant, monogastric and aquaculture species used for this study. Yucca schidigera showed that it is capable of reducing aerial ammonia concentration in pens, and ammonia odour from manure. In ruminant, Yucca could reduce methane emission, lower nitrous oxide emission, reduce urinary and fecal nitrogen. Yucca extract could be used to improve water quality by reducing the concentration of total ammonia nitrogen and nitrate in fresh and marine water used for aquaculture. Therefore, to reduce livestock footprint, Yucca may be included in the diet of cattle, sheep, goat, horses, rabbit, fishes, and shrimps with a positive result. The reviewed publications provide strong support for the use of Yucca extract as feed additive to reduce nutrient excretion and environmental impact of animal-protein production.

W.; Lindborg, R.; Scaini, A.; Da, C. T.; Manzoni, S.",2019,"The availability of water is a growing concern for flooded rice production. As such, several water-saving irrigation practices have been developed to reduce water requirements. Alternate wetting and drying and mid-season drainage have been shown to potentially reduce water requirements while maintaining rice yields when compared to continuous flooding. With the removal of permanently anaerobic conditions during the growing season, water-saving irrigation can also reduce CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) emissions, helping reduce the impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the long-term impact of water-saving irrigation on soil organic carbon (SOC)-used here as an indicator of soil health and fertility-has not been explored. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effects of common water-saving irrigation practices (alternate wetting and drying and mid-season drainage) on (i) SOC, and (ii) GHG emissions. Despite an extensive literature search, only 12 studies were found containing data to constrain the soil C balance in both continuous flooding and water-saving irrigation plots, highlighting the still limited understanding of long-term impacts of water-saving irrigation on soil health and GHG emissions. Water-saving irrigation was found to reduce emissions of CH4 by 52.3% and increased those of CO2 by 44.8%. CO2eq emissions were thereby reduced by 18.6% but the soil-to-atmosphere carbon (C) flux increased by 25% when compared to continuous flooding. Water-saving irrigation was also found to have a negative effect on both SOC-reducing concentrations by 5.2%-and soil organic nitrogen-potentially depleting stocks by more than 100 kgN/ha per year. While negative effects of water-saving irrigation on rice yield may not be visible in short-term experiments, care should be taken when assessing the long-term sustainability of these irrigation practices because they can decrease soil fertility. Strategies need to be developed for assessing the more long-term effects of these irrigation practices by considering trade-offs between water savings and other ecosystem services.","Environmental Research Letters","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab2108' target='_blank'>10.1088/1748-9326/ab2108</a>",,"What are the effects of common rice field water-saving irrigation practices (alternate wetting and drying and mid-season drainage) on soil organic carbon, and greenhouse gas emissions?",3,2,3,2,3,1,2,2,1,3,1,1,3,2,1,2,"Evidence Review"

However, current measurements regarding the influences of CSA management practices on SOC sequestration diverge widely, making it difficult to derive conclusions about individual and combined CSA management effects and bringing large uncertainties in quantifying the potential of the agricultural sector to mitigate climate change. We conducted a meta-analysis of 3,049 paired measurements from 417 peer-reviewed articles to examine the effects of three common CSA management practices on SOC sequestration as well as the environmental controlling factors. We found that, on average, biochar applications represented the most effective approach for increasing SOC content (39%), followed by cover crops (6%) and conservation tillage (5%). Further analysis suggested that the effects of CSA management practices were more pronounced in areas with relatively warmer climates or lower nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that, through adopting CSA practices, cropland could be an improved carbon sink.

Location: Worldwide. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Plants, soil, and soil microbes in terrestrial ecosystems. Methods: We synthesized data from manipulative field studies from 758 published articles to estimate the individual, combined and interactive effects of key environmental change drivers (elevated CO 2 , warming, N addition, phosphorus addition, increased rainfall and drought) on plant, soil, and soil microbe N concentrations and pools using meta-analyses. We assessed the influences of moderator variables on these effects through structural equation modelling. Results: We found that (a) N concentrations and N pools were significantly affected by the individual and combined effects of multiple drivers, with N addition (either alone or in combination with another driver) showing the strongest positive effects; (b) the individual and combined effects of these drivers differed significantly between N concentrations and N pools in plants, but seldom in soils and microbes; (c) additive effects of driver pairs on N concentrations and pools were much more common than synergistic or antagonistic effects across plants, soils and microbes; and (d) environmental and experimental factors were important moderators of the individual, combined and interactive effects of these drivers on terrestrial N. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that terrestrial N concentrations and N pools, especially those of plants, can be significantly affected by the individual and combined effects of environmental change drivers, with the interactive effects of these drivers being mostly additive.

There is currently no clear consensus regarding which stages are most susceptible to increasing environmental stress, or ‘climate extremes’. We used a meta-analytic approach to quantify variation in responses to environmental stress across multiple life stages of marine invertebrates. We identified 287 experiments in 29 papers which examined the lethal thresholds of multiple life stages (embryo, larva, juvenile and adult) of both holoplanktonic and meroplanktonic marine invertebrates subjected to the same experimental conditions of warming, acidification and hypoxia stress. Most studies considered short acute exposure to stressors. We calculated effect sizes (log response ratio) for each life stage (unpaired analysis) and the difference in effect sizes between stages of each species (paired analysis) included in each experiment. In the unpaired analysis, all significant responses were negative, indicating that warming, acidification and hypoxia tended to increase mortality. Furthermore, embryos, larvae and juveniles were more negatively affected by warming than adults. The paired analysis revealed that, when subjected to the same experimental conditions, younger life stages were more negatively affected by warming than older life stages, specifically among pairings of adults versus juveniles and larvae versus embryos. Although responses to warming are well documented, few studies of the effects of acidification and hypoxia met the criteria for inclusion in our analyses. Our results suggest that while most life stages will be negatively affected by climate change, younger stages of marine invertebrates are more sensitive to extreme heating events. © 2018 The Authors",Oikos,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.05886' target='_blank'>10.1111/oik.05886</a>","acidification; climate change; complex life cycle; extreme events; hypoxia; life stage; Invertebrata","What are the effects of experimental conditions of warming, acidification and hypoxia stress on survival rates of different life stages of holoplanktonic and meroplanktonic marine invertebrates?",3,2,3,2,3,1,2,2,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,3,"Evidence Review"

This paper has discussed and compared the mechanisms, effects and affecting factors of major contemporary strategies, including soil amendment with biochar, biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) and applications of synthetic nitrification inhibitor (NI), urease inhibitor (UI), hydrogel and slow-/controlled-release fertilizer (SRF/CRF). Among these strategies, soil amendment with biochar seems to be the most promising, considering its demonstrated effectiveness and sustainable nature. Despite the large number of biochar-relevant studies in the recent years, the data have not been systematically utilized. A database model has been proposed in this review to link the production, properties and performance of biochar and delve into the valuable information scattered in current and future biochar studies. At the same time, the other strategies should also be continuously studied for improvement. NIs and UIs need to be more stable and lasting; hydrogels and SRFs/CRFs have to be more environmentally friendly and economically sound; BNI deserves broader investigations and its future applications can be more widespread.

Results indicated that all single factors except warming inhibited isoprene emission.

Sommer, S.; Qin, W.; Ma, L.",2019,"Composting of solid waste can be associated with a loss of the agronomic value (nutrient loss), as well as a source of environmental impact through the emission of the greenhouse gases (GHG) nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) and volatilization of ammonia (NH3). Additives have been considered as a useful option to mitigate these environmental emissions, but the wider effects of using different additives on multiple gas emissions is still uncertain. Here, a global meta-analysis was conducted using 105 studies with 303 paired comparisons, to quantify the impact of different additives on NH3 and GHG emissions, considering different composting feedstock properties. On average, additives reduced the total nitrogen (TN) loss (46.4%), NH3 (44.5%), N2O (44.6%) and CH4 (68.5%) emissions, and total GHG emissions expressed as global warming potential (GWP) (54.2%) during composting. Chemical, physical and microbial additives all significantly reduced TN loss and NH3 emission; however, the strongest effect was observed for chemical additives under the condition of low moisture content (≤65%), low C/N ratios (≤20) or alkalinity (pH &gt; 7.5). Specifically, PO4 3− and Mg2+ salt had the greatest mean mitigation for TN loss (68.0%) and NH3 emission (62.0%). In contrast, physical additives (e.g. biochar and zeolite) were more effective at reducing the total GHG emissions (67.2%) compared with chemical additives because of the greater mitigation of N2O emission. Low moisture content (≤65%) or low C/N ratios (≤20) enhanced the effectiveness of chemical additives in reducing TN loss and NH3 emission. Physical additives were suggested to be more effective in reducing N2O emission at low moisture content (≤65%) or high C/N ratios (&gt;20 to ≤ 30). The magnitude of the mitigation of TN loss and NH3 emission increased as the dosage rate of PO4 3− and Mg2+ salt/superphosphate increased between 0 and 20%.

Y.",2019,"Ammonia (NH3) emission from agricultural sources has contributed significantly to air pollution, soil acidification, water eutrophication, biodiversity loss, and declining human health. Although there are numerous strategies for reducing NH3 emission from agricultural systems, the effectiveness of these measures is highly variable. Furthermore, the integrated assessment of measures to reduce NH3 emission both from livestock production and cropping systems based on animal and crop type is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a global meta-analysis and integrated assessment of measures to reduce NH3 emission from agricultural systems. Most of the studied mitigation strategies were effective in reducing NH3 emission. In the livestock production system, dietary additive, urease inhibitor (UI), manure acidification and deep manure placement have the highest mitigation potential relative to other mitigation strategies, with reduction ranges of 35.1-54.2%, 24.3-68.7%, 88.8-95.0%, and 93.8-99.7%, respectively, relative to the control, while manure storage management could significantly reduce NH3 emission by 70.0-82.1%. In the cropping system, fertilizer source, use of enhanced efficiency fertilizers, and method of field application are most effective for reducing NH3 emission. The use of ammonium nitrate, controlled release fertilizer (CRF), and deep placement of fertilizers could reduce NH3 emission by 88.3, 56.8, and 48.0%, respectively. Choosing a proper fertilizer is critical for decreasing NH3 emission from cropping systems. We conclude that carefully planned and adopted strategies suited for local conditions are promising for minimizing NH3 emission from agricultural systems on a global scale, while possible effects of those mitigation measures on the emission of greenhouse gases should be studied in the future.

However, little is known regarding the effect of cover crop species, biomass quality and quantity, and method of residue placement on greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions. Using meta-analysis, this study examined the effect of cover crop species, quality and quantity of biomass, and residue management on response ratios (RRs)of cover crops to no cover crop on CO 2 and N 2 O emissions following cash crops. All cover crop species increased CO 2 emissions, but reduced N 2 O emissions compared with no cover crop, except legumes which increased N 2 O emissions. Cover crop biomass explained 63% of variability in increased CO 2 emissions and 55% of variability in decreased N 2 O emissions. Both CO 2 and N 2 O emissions decreased polynomially with increased cover crop biomass C/N ratio, with greater rate of decline for legumes than nonlegumes. Cover crop residue incorporated into the soil increased CO 2 and N 2 O emissions compared with the residue placed at surface or removed from the soil. Cover crops emitted lower CO 2 and N 2 O emissions than no cover crops in silty loam and sandy clay loam soils, respectively, compared to clay loam and silty clay loam soils. Both soil organic carbon and total nitrogen increased with cover crop compared to no cover crop. Although CO 2 and N 2 O emissions varied with cover crop species, using legume and nonlegume cover crop mixture to enhance residue C/N ratio compared to legumes and placing the residue at the surface instead of incorporating into the soil can reduce GHG emissions.

We compiled experimental data where field-grown wheat (Triticum aestivum Linnaeus) was exposed to different CO 2 concentrations. Yield and yield components were analyzed by meta-analysis to estimate average effects, and response functions derived to assess effect size in relation to CO 2 concentration. Grain yield increased by 26% under eCO 2 (average ambient concentration of 372 ppm and elevated 605 ppm), mainly due to the increase in grain number. The response function for grain yield with CO 2 concentration strongly suggests a non-linear response, where yield stimulation levels off at ~600 ppm. This was supported by the meta-analysis, which did not indicate any significant difference in yield stimulation in wheat grown at 456–600 ppm compared to 601–750 ppm.

The decrease in soil CO2 emission was possibly caused by grazing-induced reduction in root biomass and soil moisture, while the decline in soil CH4 uptake and N2O emission was due to decreased soil moisture and substrate availability. Overall, this study provides the first large-scale evaluation on three main soil GHG fluxes in response to grazing, highlighting grazing inhibition of GHG emission but at the cost of plant productivity and soil fertility. We call for future efforts to identify an appropriate grazing intensity that is optimal to balance these complicated impacts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

L.; Kiese, R.",2019,"Climate warming will affect terrestrial ecosystems in many ways, and warming-induced changes in terrestrial carbon (C) cycling could accelerate or slow future warming. So far, warming experiments have shown a wide range of C flux responses, across and within biome types. However, past meta-analyses of C flux responses have lacked sufficient sample size to discern relative responses for a given biome type. For instance grasslands contribute greatly to global terrestrial C fluxes, and to date grassland warming experiments provide the opportunity to evaluate concurrent responses of both plant and soil C fluxes. Here, we compiled data from 70 sites (in total 622 observations) to evaluate the response of C fluxes to experimental warming across three grassland types (cold, temperate, and semi-arid), warming methods, and short (<= 3 years) and longer-term (>3 years) experiment lengths. Overall, our meta-analysis revealed that experimental warming stimulated C fluxes in grassland ecosystems with regard to both plant production (e.g., net primary productivity (NPP) 15.4%; aboveground NPP (ANPP) by 7.6%, belowground NPP (BNPP) by 11.6%) and soil respiration (Rs) (9.5%). However, the magnitude of C flux stimulation varied significantly across cold, temperate and semi-arid grasslands, in that responses for most C fluxes were larger in cold than temperate or semi-arid ecosystems. In semi-arid and temperate grasslands, ecosystem respiration (Reco) was more sensitive to warming than gross primary productivity (GPP), while the opposite was observed for cold grasslands, where warming produced a net increase in whole-ecosystem C storage. However, the stimulatory effect of warming on ANPP and Rs observed in short-term studies (<= 3 years) in both cold and temperate grasslands disappeared in longer-term experiments (>3 years). These results highlight the importance of conducting long-term warming experiments, and in examining responses across a wide range of climate.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14603' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.14603</a>",,"What are the effects of experimental climate warming on carbon fluxes in cold, temperate and semi-arid grasslands?",3,2,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

X.",2019,"Paddy rice cultivation is an important source of global anthropogenic methane emissions. Drainage the flooded soils can reduce methane substantially, but N2O emission occur concurrently, which would offset the reduction of methane emission. It remains unclear how mid-season drainage affects the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 and N2O emissions. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of mid-season drainage on GWP and the factors that control the response of GWP to mid-season drainage. Results showed that mid-season drainage decreased CH4 emission by 52% while increased N2O emission by 242%. The GWP under mid-season drainage decreased by 47% compared to continuously flooding. The yield-scaled GWP under mid-season drainage decreased by 48%. Mid-season drainage had no effect on rice grain yield. Although soil drainage times and organic matter amendment are important factors affecting CH4 and N2O emissions in rice paddy field, the study showed that neither of them had effect on the response of GWP to mid-season drainage. The reduction rate of the GWP under mid-season drainage increased when N fertilization application rate increases from 50 kg ha(-1) to > 200 kg ha(-1). This study demonstrated that CH4 is still a dominant greenhouse gas in rice paddies under water management with mid-season drainage. Nitrogen fertilization is an important factor that regulates the response of GWP to mid-season drainage. High nitrogen fertilization rate would decrease the overall emission of CH4 and N2O under mid-season drainage. However, increasing drainage times or applying organic fertilizer under mid-season does not change the overall emission rate of CH4 and N2O.","Agricultural Water Management","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.12.025' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.agwat.2018.12.025</a>",,"What are the effects of mid-season drainage on methane and nitrous oxide emissions and grain yield in rice fields?",3,1,2,2,3,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.","Biological Conservation","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.01.020' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.biocon.2019.01.020</a>",,"What are the effects of habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation, pollution, biological factors and climate change on global entomofauna populations?",2,1,2,2,3,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

In addition, we evaluated the effects of plant life form, soil depth, and experiment duration on the responses of fine roots to precipitation changes. Our results confirmed that decreased precipitation limited fine root diameter and accelerated turnover. Increased precipitation stimulated fine root elongation and enhanced the fine root accumulation. The responses of fine roots to precipitation changes varied among plants of different life forms. Tree fine root production and decomposition and non-tree fine root diameter varied most strongly under decreased precipitation. Specific root length of non-tree fine roots was much higher than that of tree fine roots under increased precipitation. Decreased precipitation limited the growth of fine roots in 20-40 cm deep soil, whereas increased precipitation promoted the growth of fine roots in both shallow and deep soil layers. The responses of fine roots to decreased precipitation were affected by experiment duration.

Here, we present the first meta-analysis and integrated assessment of NH 3 emissions and mitigation potentials for typical broiler litter manure management system (MMS) and layer manure belt MMS based on data from 96 studies. A total of 10 integrated NH 3 emission factors (EFs) and the NH 3 mitigation efficiencies (MEs) of 14 available options were provided. The estimated NH 3 emissions from the baseline scenarios of the broiler litter MMS and the layer manure belt MMS were 84.1 ± 5.9 kg AU −1 yr −1 and 53.5 ± 15.8 kg AU −1 yr −1 , respectively. The NH 3 mitigation for the broiler litter MMS should be focused on the in-house stage, while the mitigation in the layer manure belt MMS should be focused on the outdoor and land application stages. The recommended NH 3 mitigation options for the in-house stage, the outdoor stage and the land application stage were acid scrubber (−92.5%), compost biofilter (−71.9%) and changing the manure surface application to incorporation (−83.0%), respectively.

Significant differences were observed in N 2 O emission factor (EF) and area- and yield-scaled N 2 O emissions among the six vegetable types.

In this study, we report the trade-offs among grain yield, WP, reactive nitrogen (N r ) losses, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in response to irrigation management using a global meta-analysis of field experimental data published in peer-reviewed journals prior to May 2018. A total of 1490 paired data points from 162 publications and 21 counties showed that grain yield increased by 30.35% from 7357 kg ha −1 in non-irrigated systems to 9512 kg ha −1 in irrigation systems (146 mm). Similarly, WP increased by 9.91% from 19.1 to 20.5 kg ha −1 mm −1 . These increases in yield and WP varied depending on seasonal irrigation amounts, precipitation levels, annual average temperature, N application, soil organic matter, and bulk density.

More attention is being focused on how climate change impacts the performance of co-occurring native and introduced species. No synthesis has solely examined how invasive plant and animal species perform under climate change across both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. We asked the following questions: (1) How will combined and single climate change factors influence the performance of non-native species? (2) Which habitat types are more affected by climate factors in a combined or single manner? (3) What guilds/functional groups, within aquatic vs. terrestrial habitats, are more impacted by climate factors? To better understand this, we conducted a meta-analysis examining the relative influence climate change factors (carbon dioxide (CO 2 )/acidification, temperature, precipitation) have on invasive species’ performance. Our results indicate that global change factors had an overall increased performance on invasive species in terrestrial habitats with an opposite effect observed in aquatic habitats. Plant functional groups were positively affected, whereas animal guilds were generally negatively impacted by global changes. Our findings suggest that while invasive taxa are affected differently by global changes, responses are confounded by habitat type, and, therefore, to fully understand global change impacts on invasive taxa, increased representation of animal studies in terrestrial systems and plants in aquatic systems is needed. © 2019 The Authors.",Ecosphere,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2680' target='_blank'>10.1002/ecs2.2680</a>","acidification; animal guild; climate factors; climatic change; elevated CO 2; on-native invasive; plant functional group; precipitation; warming","What are the impacts of climate change factors (carbon dioxide, acidification, temperature, precipitation) on invasive species’ performance in marine and terrestrial environments in North America?",3,2,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

H.",2019,"Temperate grasslands are semi-arid ecosystems where plant growth and productivity are constrained not only by water, but also by nitrogen (N). However, rising temperatures may cause a progressive decrease in the availability of water and N to plants in temperate grasslands, negatively affecting long-term C fixation. To predict whether declining N availability would occur under a future warmer climate, we quantified the warming effects on major processes and pools of N in temperate grasslands via a meta-analysis. Although microbial biomass (-6.4%) generally decreased in warming experiments, net N mineralization increased, suggesting increased N mineralization-immobilization turnover as a result of a 'portfolio effect'. Contrary to our expectations, experimentally increasing temperature to temperate grasslands increased aboveground biomass (+8.3%), but did not increase N storage in vegetation. This occurred mainly because the vegetation shifted to species with lower N demands, e.g., C-4 plants, reducing the role of N as a limiting factor in productivity. By contrast, N storage in the microbial biomass declined by 7.7%. Despite the large decline in soil total N (-3.8%), soil available N did not decrease with warming. Soil dissolved organic N and nitrate even showed a positive response, increasing by an average of 27.3% and 60.2%, respectively. Overall, our work indicates that under a future warmer climate, soil N availability might not decrease in temperate grasslands, even in the case of microbial decline. In the short term, warming may affect soil N availability mainly by its effect on N mineralization-immobilization turnover, rather than plant N uptake.","Soil Biology & Biochemistry","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.01.002' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.01.002</a>",,"What is the effect of a warming climate on plant, soil and microbial nitrogen dynamics in grassland and steppe?",2,1,2,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Methods: To identify site-specific factors that influence N2O emission (kg N2O-N ha(-1)) in residue returning systems, we performed a meta-analysis involving 260 comparisons from 72 studies. Results: The data indicated that significant promoting effects were observed under residue returning by rotary tillage, no-tillage and mulch, whereas N2O release was significantly inhibited by 8% under residue returning by plough. For other contributors, the stimulatory and significant effects occurred in upland fields, under short- and medium-term residue returning durations, acidic/neutral soils, medium organic C and clay content. Nitrogen fertilizer application significantly stimulated N2O emission, even though application rate at 100-150 kg N ha(-1) was inhibitory. Although a negative correlation between residue C/N ratio and N2O emission has been shown, residue returning could not reduce N2O emission with a higher C/N ratio and amount.

S.; Ferreira, V.",2019,"The metabolism of forest streams depends on the decomposition of plant litter of terrestrial origin. In turn, the rate at which litter decomposes depends on litter characteristics, decomposer activity, environmental characteristics, and their interactions. Atmospheric changes, such as increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) and in temperature, may affect all these variables. Here, we report the results of a meta-analysis of 41 studies conducted worldwide between 1993 and 2017 on the effects of elevated atmospheric [CO2], elevated temperature, or both (temperature + [CO2]) on litter decomposition in streams. Elevated temperature significantly increased litter decomposition rates, whereas elevated [CO2] and temperature + [CO2] did not significantly affect litter decomposition rates. The effect of elevated temperature did not depend on the type of study (i.e., laboratory or field study, correlative field or manipulative field study) but in correlative field studies, the temperature effect was stronger over latitudinal than altitudinal gradients. Effects of elevated temperature also did not depend on the type of decomposer community (microbial or microbial and macroinvertebrates) but effects were always significant for total litter decomposition (both microbes and macroinvertebrates involved), whereas microbial-driven litter decomposition was significantly affected only in manipulative studies. Effects of elevated temperature did not depend on the litter identity, although significant effects were found for some litter genera but not others. In terrestrial ecosystems, the elevated temperature was found to increase litter decomposition rates, whereas elevated [CO2] decreased litter decomposition rates. Study type (laboratory or field) and litter identity were important moderators of the response of litter decomposition to elevated temperature and [CO2] in terrestrial ecosystems. These differences between soil and stream ecosystems may be partially due to intrinsic differences (such as moisture that is not limiting in streams) between these ecosystems. In addition, our meta-analysis is geographically biased with most studies being conducted in Europe. More studies in other parts of the world could allow for a better understanding of the effects of climate warming and [CO2] increases on litter decomposition, the global carbon cycle, and biochemistry in streams.","International Review of Hydrobiology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201801965' target='_blank'>10.1002/iroh.201801965</a>",,"What are the effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and temperature on litter decomposition in streams?",3,1,3,2,3,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

In the present investigation, a comprehensive meta-analysis involving 386 published reports and including 4481 observations has been carried out. The goal of the research was to determine the response of plants to their C-N-P stoichiometry due to elevated levels of global atmospheric CO2. The results showed that rising CO2 altered the concentration of C (+2.19%, P < 0.05), N (-9.73%, P < 0.001) and P (-3.23%, P < 0.001) and C: N (+13.29%, P < 0.001) and N: P ratios (-7.32%, P < 0.0001). Overall, a slightly increasing trend in the C: P ratio (P > 0.05) in the plant was observed. However, plant leaf, shoot and herbaceous type of plants showed more sensitivity to rising CO2. CO2 magnitude exhibited a positive effect (P < 0.05) on C: N ratio. Additionally, ' CO2 acclimation' hypothesis as proposed by the authors of the current paper was also tested in the study. Results obtained, especially, show changes of C and N concentrations and C: P ratio to an obvious down-regulation for long-term CO2 fumigation.

Globally, the effect of earthworms is supposed to upsurge over the coming decades; they will not only enhance the carbon sequestration in the soils but will enhance the release of greenhousegasessuch as N2O,CO2,and CH4. It is a debatable topic whether earthworms act as an origin or sink of GHG from the soil. However, in this review, we have focused on all the factors which are involved in either sequestration or emission of GHG by earthworm and microbes present in their gut, viz.increased temperature, residues, and ecological category of earthworms. Based on the current knowledge, there is clear indication that GHG emissions are elevated through bioturbation process. Furthermore, an investigation is needed to know the components involved in GHG emissions. However, we recommend a full accounting of the factors involved in GHG emission and factors that should be considered to mitigate the increased temperature worldwide.","International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-018-1922-5' target='_blank'>10.1007/s13762-018-1922-5</a>",,"What effect do earthworms have on greenhouse gas emissions from soil?",2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,"Evidence Review"

J.; Akiyama, H.",2019,"Indirect N2O emissions from agricultural nitrogen (N) leaching and runoff in water bodies contribute significantly to the global atmospheric N2O budget. However, considerable uncertainty regarding this source remains in the bottom-up N2O inventory. Indirect N2O emission factor associated with N leaching and runoff (EF5: kg N2O-N per kg of NO3--N) incorporate three components for groundwater and surface drainage (EF5g), rivers (EF5r), and estuaries (EF5e). The 2006 IPCC default EF5 value was based on a small number of studies available at the time. Here we present the synthesis of 254 measurements of EF5, dissolved N2O, and nitrate from 106 studies. Our results do not support the further downward revision of EF5g by the IPCC and suggest an upward revision of EF5g of 0.0060. The emission factors for groundwater and springs (0.0079) was higher than that for surface drainage (0.0040). The emission factor for lakes, ponds, and reservoirs was 0.0012, whereas that for rivers was 0.0030, and a combined EF5r was 0.0026. Estimated EF5r and EF5e (0.0026) values from the study were close to the current IPCC default values (0.0025 each).

J.; Linquist, B.",2019,"Rice is a main staple food for roughly half of the world's population, but rice agriculture is also a main source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Many studies have reported that water management (e.g. alternate wetting and drying, intermittent irrigation, mid-season drain, aerobic rice) affects rice yields and methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from rice paddies. However, these studies span a variety of practices and vary in experimental design and results, making it difficult to determine their global response from individual experiments. Here we conducted a meta-analysis using 201 paired observations from 52 studies to assess the effects of water management practices on GHG emissions and rice yield. Overall, compared to continuous flooding, non-continuous flooding practices reduced CH4 emissions by 53%, increased N2O emissions by 105%, and decreased yield by 3.6%. Importantly, N2O emissions were low, contributing, on average, 12% to the combined global warming potential (GWP; CH4 + N2O). As a result, non-continuous flooding reduced GWP (-44%) and yield-scaled GWP (-42%). However, non-continuous flooding practices stimulated N2O emissions to a greater degree in soils with high organic carbon or with manure additions. The reduction in CH4 emissions increased with the number of drying events, soil drying severity, and the number of unflooded days. Currently, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scaling factors for single and multiple (>= 2) drying events are 0.6 and 0.52. Based on this analysis using actual side-by-side field studies, we suggest changing these to 0.67 for a single event and 0.36 for multiple events.","Field Crops Research","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2019.02.010' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.fcr.2019.02.010</a>",,"What are the effects of water management of rice systems on methane and nitrous oxide emissions, global warming potential, yield, and yield-scaled global warming potential?",2,2,3,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,3,"Evidence Review"

D.; Mulder, J.; Wang, J. G.; Zhang, X. S.",2018,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas that also plays the primary role in stratospheric ozone depletion. The use of nitrogen fertilizers is known as the major reason for atmospheric N2O increase. Empirical bottom-up models therefore estimate agricultural N2O inventories using N loading as the sole predictor, disregarding the regional heterogeneities in soil inherent response to external N loading. Several environmental factors have been found to influence the response in soil N2O emission to N fertilization, but their interdependence and relative importance have not been addressed properly. Here, we show that soil pH is the chief factor explaining regional disparities in N2O emission, using a global meta-analysis of 1,104 field measurements. The emission factor (EF) of N2O increases significantly (p < .001) with soil pH decrease. The default EF value of 1.0%, according to IPCC (Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change) for agricultural soils, occurs at soil pH 6.76. Moreover, changes in EF with N fertilization (i.e. EF) is also negatively correlated (p < .001) with soil pH. This indicates that N2O emission in acidic soils is more sensitive to changing N fertilization than that in alkaline soils. Incorporating our findings into bottom-up models has significant consequences for regional and global N2O emission inventories and reconciling them with those from top-down models. Moreover, our results allow region-specific development of tailor-made N2O mitigation measures in agriculture.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13966' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.13966</a>",,"What is the impact of pH on nitrous oxide emissions from soils?",2,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

B.; Nahrowi",2018,"This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis on the effect of 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) on enteric methane (CH4) emissions from ruminants. A total of 12 in vivo studies from 10 articles were integrated into a database. Ruminant species included were dairy cows, beef cattle and sheep. Concentration of 3-NOP in diets varied from 0 to 280mg/kg dry matter intake (DMI). Parameters included were CH4 emissions, rumen fermentation, microbial population, nutrient digestibility and animal performance. Meta-analysis of data was performed by using mixed model methodology in which different studies were treated as random effects whereas 3-NOP addition levels in diets of ruminants were treated as fixed effects. Results showed that increasing level of 3-NOP addition in diets of ruminants decreased enteric CH4 emissions per unit of body weight, CH4/DMI, CH4/milk produced, CH4/digested organic matter or CH4/gross energy intake (p<.05). Production of H-2 was higher with increasing level of 3-NOP addition (p<.001). Addition of 3-NOP decreased total VFA concentration (p<.01), and decreased and increased proportions of C-2 and C-3, respectively (p<.001). Addition of 3-NOP decreased archaea population (p<.01) but it did not change total bacteria and protozoa populations. The substance had minor effect on digestibility of nutrients. Production performance of dairy cows and beef cattle was limitedly influenced by the addition of 3-NOP in the diets, and it had no negative effect on DMI of ruminants. It is concluded that 3-NOP is an effective feed additive to mitigate enteric CH4 emissions without compromising productive performance of ruminants.","Italian Journal of Animal Science","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051x.2017.1404945' target='_blank'>10.1080/1828051x.2017.1404945</a>",,"What is the effectiveness of use of 3-nitrooxypropanol as feed additive for mitigating enteric methane emissions from ruminants?",3,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"

A.; Novak, J.",2019,"Biochar can reduce both nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrate (NO3-) leaching, but refining biochar's use for estimating these types of losses remains elusive. For example, biochar properties such as ash content and labile organic compounds may induce transient effects that alter N-based losses. Thus, the aim of this meta-analysis was to assess interactions between biochar-induced effects on N2O emissions and NO3- retention, regarding the duration of experiments as well as soil and land use properties. Data were compiled from 88 peer-reviewed publications resulting in 608 observations up to May 2016 and corresponding response ratios were used to perform a random effects meta-analysis, testing biochar's impact on cumulative N2O emissions, soil NO3- concentrations and leaching in temperate, semi-arid, sub-tropical, and tropical climate. The overall N2O emissions reduction was 38%, but N2O emission reductions tended to be negligible after one year. Overall, soil NO3- concentrations remained unaffected while NO3- leaching was reduced by 13% with biochar; greater leaching reductions (>26%) occurred over longer experimental times (i.e. >30 days). Biochar had the strongest N2O emission reducing effect in paddy soils (Anthrosols) and sandy soils (Arenosols). The use of biochar reduced both N2O emissions and NO3- leaching in arable farming and horticulture, but it did not affect these losses in grasslands and perennial crops. In conclusion, the time-dependent impact on N2O emissions and NO3- leaching is a crucial factor that needs to be considered in order to develop and test resilient and sustainable biochar-based N loss mitigation strategies.

E.; Diaz-Pulido, G.; Comeau, S.",2019,"Coralline algae are foundation species in many hard-bottom ecosystems acting as a settlement substrate, and binding together and even creating reefs in some locations. Ocean acidification is known to be a major threat to coralline algae. However, the effects of ocean warming are less certain. Here we bring multiple lines of evidence together to discuss the potential impacts of ocean warming on these ecologically crucial taxa. We use a meta-analysis of 40 responses within 14 different studies available which assessed the effects of increasing temperature on coralline algal calcification in laboratory experiments. We find a net negative impact of increasing temperature on coralline algal calcification at 5.2 degrees C above ambient conditions. Conversely, negative effects are observed when temperature drops below 2.0 degrees C from ambient conditions. We propose that some coralline algae will be more capable of both acclimatizing and locally adapting to increasing ocean temperatures over the coming decades. This is because many species possess short generation times, the ability to opportunistically rapidly utilize open space, and relatively high phenotypic plasticity. However, less resistant and resilient species will be those that are long-lived, those with long generation times, or with narrow thermal tolerances (e.g., tropical taxa living close to their thermal maxima). Additionally, ocean warming will occur simultaneously with ocean acidification, a potentially greater threat to coralline algae, which could also reduce any tolerance to ocean warming for many species. To maximize the potential to accurately determine how coralline algae will respond to future ocean warming and marine heatwaves, future research should use environmentally relevant temperature treatments, use appropriate acclimation times and follow best practices in experimental design.","Frontiers in Marine Science","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00186' target='_blank'>10.3389/fmars.2019.00186</a>",,"What are the effects ocean warming on coralline algal calcification?",2,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,3,"Evidence Review"

H.; Ma, J.",2019,"The application of biochar to agricultural ecosystems is a potential solution to mitigate climate change and guarantee food security. However, the impacts of biochar on greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield are usually evaluated separately and the results are contradictory in individual studies. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted based on data from 28 peer-reviewed studies to quantify the impacts of biochar application on greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield using yield-scaled greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI). Potential factors (experimental conditions and properties of soil and biochar) influencing the effect of biochar on yield-scaled GHGI were explored. The results showed that overall, biochar significantly reduced yield-scaled GHGI by 29%. The reductions in yield-scaled GHGI induced by biochar varied with different experimental conditions and properties of soil and biochar. However, the difference was only significant between the two cropping systems, with significantly greater reduction being observed in dry lands (-41%) than in paddy fields (-17%). Therefore, it is suggested that biochar amendment in dry lands may bring more environmental and agronomic benefits than that in paddy fields. The response of crop yield to biochar application further implied that biochar made from crop residue, biochar produced at low pyrolysis temperatures (<= 400 degrees C), and biochar with high pH (>9.0) might contribute to save the production cost of biochar while promoting crop yield in agricultural ecosystems. Long-term field trials are required to elucidate the persistence of the impact of biochar on reducing yield-scaled GHGI and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. The balance between the price of biochar production and the benefits brought by biochar should also be focused in further studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Despite reports of extensive coral bleaching and up to 97% coral mortality induced by El Nino events, a quantitative synthesis of the nature, intensity, and drivers of El Nino and La Nina impacts on corals is lacking. Herein, we first present a global meta-analysis of studies quantifying the effects of El Nino/La Nina-warming on corals, surveying studies from both the primary literature and International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS) Proceedings. Overall, the strongest signal for El Nino/La Nina-associated coral bleaching was long-term mean temperature; bleaching decreased with decreasing long-term mean temperature (n = 20 studies). Additionally, coral cover losses during El Nino/La Nina were shaped by localized maximum heat stress and long-term mean temperature (n = 28 studies). Second, we present a method for quantifying coral heat stress which, for any coral reef location in the world, allows extraction of remotely-sensed degree heating weeks (DHW) for any date (since 1982), quantification of the maximum DHW, and the time lag since the maximum DHW. Using this method, we show that the 2015/16 El Nino event instigated unprecedented global coral heat stress across the world's oceans. With El Nino events expected to increase in frequency and severity this century, it is imperative that we gain a clear understanding of how these thermal stress anomalies impact different coral species and coral reef regions. We therefore finish with recommendations for future coral bleaching studies that will foster improved syntheses, as well as predictive and adaptive capacity to extreme warming events.","Plos One","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0190957' target='_blank'>10.1371/journal.pone.0190957</a>","great-barrier-reef; climate-change; temperature; recovery; stress; future; ocean; conservation; variability; resilience; Science &amp; Technology - Other Topics","What are the effects of El Niño/La Niña-warming on cover and bleaching of coral reefs?",2,2,3,2,3,1,3,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

While all areas are expected to experience elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (up arrow C) and higher temperatures (up arrow T), the north east will get considerably wetter (up arrow W) while the south much drier (down arrow W). It is likely that these changes will have an impact on pastures and consequently on grazing livestock. This study aims to evaluate the expected changes to pasture yield and quality caused by up arrow C, up arrow T, up arrow W and down arrow W across the different European regions and across different plant functional groups (PFGs). Data was collected from 143 studies giving a total of 998 observations. Mixed models were used to estimate expected changes in above ground dry weight (AGDW) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and were implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The results showed an increase in AGDW under up arrow C, particularly for shrubs (+71.6%), though this is likely to be accompanied by a reduction in N concentrations (-4.8%). up arrow T will increase yields in Alpine and northern areas (+82.6%), though other regions will experience little change or else decreases. up arrow T will also reduce N concentrations, especially for shrubs (-13.6%) and forbs (-18.5%). down arrow W will decrease AGDW for all regions and PFGs, though will increase N concentrations (+11.7%). Under up arrow W there was a 33.8% increase in AGDW.

Our goal was to explore generalities and mechanisms of responses of soil microbial communities to altered precipitation and implications for C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. LocationTime periodGlobal. 2001-2017. Major taxa studiedMethodsSoil microbes. We used the meta-analytical technique to synthesize data of 41 increased (IPPT) and 53 decreased precipitation (DPPT) studies from 65 publications worldwide. The data covered broad variations in climate, percentage of precipitation change, experimental duration and soil properties. ResultsMain conclusionsThe fungi to bacteria ratio did not show a water-tolerant shift, but the community compositions within the bacteria did. Microbial biomass showed a higher response to moderate IPPT than moderate DPPT, whereas it was more sensitive to extreme DPPT than extreme IPPT, suggesting that the responses of microbial biomass to altered precipitation are double asymmetric. However, such asymmetric responses of microbial biomass varied with climate humidity and soil texture: microbial biomass was more sensitive to IPPT at xeric sites than at mesic sites, whereas it was more responsive to DPPT in humid areas; microbial biomass in coarse-textured soils was more sensitive to altered precipitation than that in fine-textured soils. In addition, microbial response was positively correlated with the responses of aboveground/belowground plant biomass, soil respiration and organic C content. Our meta-analysis provides the first evidence that the asymmetric response of microbial biomass to altered precipitation varies with climate humidity and soil texture. Given the coordinated responses in the plant-soil-microorganism C continuum, our synthesis extends the double asymmetric model and provides a framework for understanding and modelling responses of ecosystem C cycling to global precipitation change.","Global Ecology and Biogeography","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.12761' target='_blank'>10.1111/geb.12761</a>",,"What are the effects of altered precipitation on soil microbial community compositions?",3,2,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

Based on the method of evaluation of their samples, the studies are divided into three groups. The first category consists of research into a set of urban green spaces in one part of or in an entire city, mainly conducted through remote sensing and satellite maps. The second category investigates city parks or several urban parks with recognizable shapes and locations. In this section, information was mainly gathered by virtue of field observations. The third category relates to studies in which a part of urban space according to different scenarios of green space placement was modeled by simulation.

B.",2018,"Ocean acidification changes the carbonate chemistry of seawater in a manner that reduces the biomineralisation rate of reef-building corals. Other effects of acidification on coral physiology are less well explored, and recent debate has focused on whether ocean acidification causes a change in Symbiodinium densities within tropical and subtropical reef-building corals. Within the framework of null-hypothesis significance testing, some aquaria experiments have provided evidence for a decrease in symbiont densities within coral tissue under ocean acidification (whilst others have suggested an increase). However, null effects have prevailed in the majority of such experiments, and so the question has remained unresolved. This study attempted to resolve this question using a meta-analytic framework, by establishing the effect sizes for symbiont density change under ocean acidification from a structured search of the literature. A regression of effect size (Hedge's d) versus level of ocean acidification revealed a statistically significant negative relationship, with symbiont density per cm(2) decreasing as the level of ocean acidification increased. The decline amounted to an additional 0.07 standard deviations of difference in symbiont density between corals in control (near present day) and acidified seawater with every 100 mu atm of increase in partial pressure of CO2 in seawater (a relationship with an r(2) of 0.24). A further unresolved question is whether ocean acidification will synergistically exacerbate (or diminish) symbiont density reductions caused by elevated temperature. An analysis of covariance did not reveal a greater decline in symbiont densities with increasing acidification at elevated temperature compared to non-stressful temperature, though this latter analysis should be viewed as exploratory due to a lower sample size. The well-supported evidence for a decline in symbiont densities in tropical and subtropical corals under ocean acidification now provides an impetus for sustained investigation of the consequences of such a change for holobiont functioning and the broader function of the coral reef ecosystem.","Coral Reefs","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-018-1720-z' target='_blank'>10.1007/s00338-018-1720-z</a>",,"What is the effect of ocean acidiﬁcation on symbiont densities of tropical and subtropical scleractinian corals?",3,2,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,3,1,1,3,3,2,1,"Evidence Review"

H.; Xia, F.",2018,"Conservation tillage has been widely adopted in agricultural lands worldwide and is considered a potential strategy for climate change mitigation through enhanced carbon sequestration. However, conservation tillage may alter soil N2O emissions, which may diminish the potential climate change mitigation benefits. Based on 212 observations from 40 publications, a meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively assess the effects of climate regimes, initial soil properties, and type/duration of agricultural practices on soil N2O emission following application of conservation tillage. Overall, conservation tillage significantly increased soil N2O emission by 17.8% compared to conventional tillage. The greatest increase in N2O emission was observed from soils in tropical climates (70.1%) experiencing short-term (29.3%) application of conservation tillage. Soil pH and clay content significantly influenced N2O emission, while overall soil texture and soil organic carbon (SOC) were not effective predictors of soil N2O emission following conservation tillage. According to the categorical metaanalysis, agricultural practices, including water, residue, and rotation managements and crop types, significantly affected soil N2O emission following conservation tillage. Conservation tillage induced N2O emissions were mitigated with rain-fed cropping systems, residue removal, crop rotation and cultivation of beans and some vegetables. Significant categorical variables affecting N2O emission were mainly attributed to soil aeration and substrate availability, which were important factors affecting nitrification and denitrification processes. Overall, the conservation tillage induced N2O emission factor (EFad) increased by 0.40%, suggesting an attenuation of climate change benefits from increased N2O emission. Our meta-analysis provides a scientific basis for assessing the effects of conservation tillage on N2O emissions and provides site-specific information to mitigate N2O emissions associated with conservation tillage practices.","Soil & Tillage Research","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2018.05.006' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.still.2018.05.006</a>",,"What is the effect of conservation tillage on soil nitrous oxide emissions?",3,2,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

M.; Chalabi, Z.; Allen, E.; Haines, A.; Dangour, A. D.",2018,"Environmental changes threaten agricultural production, food security, and health. Previous reviews suggest that environmental changes will substantially affect future yields of starchy dietary staples. To date, no comprehensive global analysis of the impacts of environmental change on (nonstaple) vegetables and legumes-important constituents of healthy diets-has been reported. We systematically searched for articles published between 1975 and 2016 on the effects of ambient temperature, tropospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and ozone (O-3) concentrations, water availability, and salinization on yields and nutritional quality of vegetables and legumes. We estimated mean effects of standardized environmental changes using observed exposure-response relationships and conducted meta-analyses where possible. We identified 174 relevant papers reporting 1,540 experiments. The mean (95% CI) reported yield changes for all vegetables and legumes combined were +22.0% (+11.6% to +32.5%) for a 250-ppm increase in CO2 concentration, -8.9% (-15.6% to -2.2%) for a 25% increase in O-3 concentration,-34.7% (-44.6% to -24.9%) for a 50% reduction in water availability, and -2.3% (-3.7% to -0.9%) for a 25% increase in salinity. In papers with baseline temperatures >20 degrees C, a 4 degrees C increase in temperature reduced mean yields by -31.5% (-41.4% to -21.5%). Impacts of environmental changes on nutritional quality were mixed. In a business-as-usual scenario, predicted changes in environmental exposures would lead to reductions in yields of non-staple vegetables and legumes. Where adaptation possibilities are limited, this may substantially change their global availability, affordability, and consumption in the mid to long term. Our results stress the importance of prioritizing agricultural developments, to minimize potential reductions in vegetable and legume yields and associated negative health effects.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1800442115' target='_blank'>10.1073/pnas.1800442115</a>",,"What are the effects of changes in ambient temperature, tropospheric carbon dioxide, and ozone concentrations, water availability, and salinization on yields and nutritional quality of vegetables and legumes?",3,2,3,2,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,"Evidence Review"

Here, a meta-analysis of 27 individual studies was carried out to assess the response patterns of soil CH4 uptake to grazing in steppe ecosystems of China. The weighted log response ratio was used to assess the effect size. Results: We found that heavy grazing significantly depressed soil CH4 uptake by 36.47%, but light and moderate grazing had no significant effects in grassland ecosystem. The response of grassland soil CH4 uptake to grazing also was found to depend upon grazing intensity, grazing duration and climatic types. The increase in soil temperature and reduced aboveground biomass and soil moisture induced by heavy grazing may be the major regulators of the soil CH4 uptake. Conclusions: These findings imply that grazing effects on soil CH4 uptake are highly context-specific and that grazing in different grasslands might be managed differently to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.","Bmc Ecology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12898-018-0168-x' target='_blank'>10.1186/s12898-018-0168-x</a>","Grazing; Steppe; CH4 uptake; Soil; Meta-analysis; China; tibetan plateau; itrous-oxide; elevated co2; ch4; grasslands; fluxes; 2o; carbon; ecosystems; emission; Environmental Sciences &amp; Ecology","What is the effect of grazing on soil methane uptake in Eurasian steppe of China?",3,2,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"
125760,"Global analysis of agricultural soil denitrification in response to fertilizer nitrogen","Wang, J. Y.; Chadwick, D. R.; Cheng, Y.; Yan, X. Y.",2018,"Terrestrial soil denitrification is of great importance for closing the nitrogen (N) cycle, yet the current understanding of soil denitrification response to N fertilization remains uncertain. While there has been a focus on factors controlling N2O fluxes from agricultural soils because of its global warming effect, much less is known about factors controlling total denitrification losses, yet these can be sufficiently large to affect N use efficiency. Here, we collated 353 observations from 74 papers and conducted a global-scale meta-analysis to explore the effects of N fertilization on agricultural soil denitrification (N2O+N-2) where the acetylene inhibition technique was used. Relative to the control, N fertilization significantly increased soil denitrification by an average of 174%, although the magnitude of this increase differed significantly across environmental and soil conditions. Soil denitrification was more responsive to N fertilization in grasslands than in croplands. The changes in soil denitrification increased exponentially when the rates of synthetic N fertilizer application <= 250 kg N ha(-1), but above this threshold, there were no further increases. The responses of soil denitrification to N fertilization were negatively correlated with soil clay content, C: N ratio, and bulk density. The comparable responses of soil N2O emissions (165%) and denitrification to N fertilization resulted in a small insignificant decrease of the N2O: N-2 ratio. Organic fertilizer applied with and without synthetic N fertilizer can contribute to lower N2O emissions probably by facilitating the last step of soil denitrification to N-2 production. Taken together, we conclude that these findings can provide important insights on regulating soil denitrification, which might contribute to improvement of N use efficiency and elimination of its negative impacts in agro-ecosystems.

L.; Butterbach-Bahl, K.",2018,"It is widely recommended that crop straw be returned to croplands to maintain or increase soil carbon (C) storage in arable soils. However, because C and nitrogen (N) biogeochemical cycles are closely coupled, straw return may also affect soil reactive N (Nr) losses, but these effects remain uncertain, especially in terms of the interactions between soil C sequestration and Nr losses under straw addition. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis using 363 publications to assess the overall effects of straw return on soil Nr losses, C sequestration and crop productivity in agroecosystems. Our results show that on average, compared to mineral N fertilization, straw return with same amount of mineral N fertilizer significantly increased soil organic C (SOC) content (14.9%), crop yield (5.1%), and crop N uptake (10.9%). Moreover, Nr losses in the form of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from rice paddies (17.3%), N leaching (8.7%), and runoff (25.6%) were significantly reduced, mainly due to enhanced microbial N immobilization. However, N2O emissions from upland fields (21.5%) and ammonia (NH3) emissions (17.0%) significantly increased following straw return, mainly due to the stimulation of nitrification/denitrification and soil urease activity. The increase in NH3 and N2O emissions was significantly and negatively correlated with straw C/N ratio and soil clay content. Regarding the interactions between C sequestration and Nr losses, the increase in SOC content following straw return was significantly and positively correlated with the decrease in N leaching and runoff. However, at a global scale, straw return increased net Nr losses from both rice and upland fields due to a greater stimulation of NH3 emissions than the reduction in N leaching and runoff. The trade-offs between increased net Nr losses and soil C sequestration highlight the importance of reasonably managing straw return to soils to limit NH3 emissions without decreasing associated C sequestration potential.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14466' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.14466</a>",,"What are the effects of straw return on reactive nitrogen loss pathways, crop productivity and soil carbon sequestration in agroecosystems?",3,2,2,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

A.",2018,"The crucial biogeochemical processes such as carbon and nutrient cycling are increasingly altered at the eco-system scale by global environmental changes. Although soil extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) play a critical role in biogeochemical processes, the global patterns of soil EEAs in a changing world remain elusive. Here, we synthesized eight EEAs involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) acquisition in response to seven global change factors based on 132 peer-reviewed papers. Our results showed that elevated CO2 concentration had no significant effects on soil EEAs. Nitrogen addition stimulated C-acquisition (9.1%) and P acquisition (9.9%) EEAs, but suppressed oxidase activity (-6.8%). Phosphorus addition decreased P-acquisition EEA (-19.8%), while combined N and P addition increased C-acquisition EEA (30.7%). Moreover, decrease in precipitation dramatically suppressed oxidase activity (-47.2%), increase in precipitation marginally stimulated N-acquisition EEA (16.7%), while warming significantly decreased oxidase activity (-10.9%) and had minor positive effect on hydrolytic enzymes. Overall, our results provide some evidence (with exceptions) for the resource allocation theory of microbial enzyme production, and indicate that EEAs are generally more sensitive to nutrient addition than to atmospheric and climate change. We have shown that global environmental changes can alter EEAs, which have implications for soil carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and plant productivity. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the responses of EEAs to global change and to collect data from particularly non-forest ecosystems (e.g., wetland, tundra and desert) and global-change drivers (other than N addition) that lack of EEA data. Our synthesis of the responses of soil enzyme activities to global change drivers can be used to develop better representations of microbial processes in ecosystem and earth system models.","Soil Biology & Biochemistry","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.05.001' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.05.001</a>",,"What are the effects of nutrient addition and climate change on soil extracellular enzyme activities?",2,2,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,3,3,2,1,"Evidence Review"

F.; Luo, Y.; Wang, K.",2018,"Carbon-nitrogen (C-N) interactions in terrestrial ecosystems regulate climate-C cycle feedbacks. How additions of N affect soil C sequestration and then regulate climate change, however, are not fully understood. Previous studies have assessed effects of N on bulk soil organic C (SOC) but have not yet carefully examined its effects on different SOC fractions, which determine how fast the N-regulated C cycle feeds back to climate. Here we synthesized data from 36 studies with 296 observations by a meta-analysis to evaluate the responses of SOC fractions to N additions. We hypothesized that additions of N might increase both labile and non-labile C fractions. The SOC that was separated by density fractionation increased by 18.3% for free light fractions and by 3.0% for heavy density fractions without change in the occluded light fraction under N addition compared with the control. The SOC that was separated by aggregate fractionation increased by 4.4% for macroaggregate-associated fractions and by 6.5% for aggregate mineral-associated fractions without change in the microaggregate-associated fraction under N additions. When bulk SOC was separated by chemical permanganate oxidation, the oxidizable fraction increased by 10.4%, whereas the unoxidizable fraction increased by 4.5%. The changes in different soil C fractions were related to the mechanisms of SOC stabilization. Because of the significant increases in non-labile SOC fractions, our findings suggest that on a global scale, increased additions of N might promote SOC accumulation and slow down climate change in the long term. Our results will be useful in model development for better prediction of SOC sequestration under additions of N.","European Journal of Soil Science","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12716' target='_blank'>10.1111/ejss.12716</a>","terrestrial ecosystems; matter; dynamics; storage; deposition; turnover; sequestration; decomposition; metaanalysis; saturation; Agriculture","What are the effects of nitrogen addition on soil organic carbon fractions?",2,2,2,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"

C.",2018,"In an effort to optimize soil management practices that can help mitigate terrestrial carbon emissions, biochar has been applied to a wide range of soil environments to examine its effect on soil greenhouse gas emissions. Such studies have shown that the soil methane (CH4) flux response can vary widely leading to both increase and decrease in CH4 flux upon biochar amendment. To address this discrepancy, multiple meta-analysis studies have been performed in recent years to determine the key factors that may control the direction of CH4 flux upon biochar treatment. However, even comparing across conclusions from meta-analyses reveals disagreement upon which factors ultimately determine the change in direction and magnitude of CH4 flux due to biochar addition. Furthermore, using multiple observations from a single study can lead to misinterpretation of the influence of a factor within a meta-analysis due to non-independence. In this study, we use a multivariate meta-regression approach that allows factor interactions to investigate which biochar, soil, and management practice factors in combination or individually best explain the CH4 flux response in past biochar amendment studies. Our results show that the interaction of multiple soil factors (i.e., water saturation, soil texture, and soil organic carbon content) best explains the soil CH4 flux response to biochar addition (minimum deviance information criterion (DIC) value along with lowest heterogeneity) as compared to all models utilizing individual factors alone. These findings provide insight into the specific soil factors that should be taken into account simultaneously when optimizing the CH4 flux response to biochar amendments and building empirical models to quantitatively predict soil CH4 flux.","Environmental Science-Processes & Impacts","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8em00278a' target='_blank'>10.1039/c8em00278a</a>","production potentials; itrous-oxide; emissions; water; texture; redox; oxidation; field; Chemistry; Environmental Sciences &amp; Ecology","What is the effect of biochar addition on the soil methane flux?",3,2,3,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

In this study, we assembled a large dataset that comprised 124 published studies concerning N addition experiments, including 570 observations at 127 sites across China, to quantify the responses of belowground C dynamics to N enrichment in terrestrial ecosystems in China by a meta-analysis. The results showed that overall soil organic C, dissolved organic C (DOC) and soil microbial biomass C (MBC) increased by 1.8, 7.4, and 8.8%, respectively (P < 0.05), in response to N enrichment; belowground biomass and litter increased by 14.6 and 24.4%, respectively (P < 0.05); and soil respiration increased by 6.1% (P < 0.05). N enrichment promoted C inputs into the soil mainly by increasing litter and belowground biomass inputs. Additionally, N enrichment increased C output by increasing soil respiration. Land use type and N addition level had different impacts on the soil C pool and on soil respiration. DOC, MBC, and litter exhibited more positive responses to N deposition in cooler and more arid regions than in other regions. The meta-analysis indicated that N enrichment had a positive impact on belowground C cycles in China. Climate played a greater role than did N deposition level in affecting processes of ecosystem C cycling.

Agroforestry systems, defined as the presence of trees on external and internal boundaries, cropland, or on any other available niche of farmland, can provide both climate change mitigation and food. There are several types of agroforestry systems with different rates of above ground and soil carbon (C) sequestration. The amount of carbon sequestered can depend on the type of system, climate, time since land use change and previous land use. Data was collected from a total of 86 published and peer reviewed studies on soil and above ground carbon sequestration for different agroforestry systems, climates and regions in the world. The objective was to understand which agroforestry systems provide the greatest benefits, and what are the main factors influencing, soil and above ground carbon sequestration. The results show that, on average, more soil carbon sequestration occurs in agroforestry systems classified as silvopastoral (4.38 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)), and more above ground carbon sequestration occurs in improved fellows (11.29 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)). On average, carbon benefits are greater in agroforestry systems Tropical climates when compared to agroforestry systems located in other climates, both in terms of soil (2.23 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)) and above ground (4.85 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)). In terms of land use change, the greatest above ground carbon sequestration (12.8 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)) occurs when degraded land is replaced by improved fallow and the greatest soil carbon sequestration (4.38 tC ha(-1) yr(-1)) results from the transition of a grassland system to a silvopastoral system. Time since the change is implemented was the main factor influencing above ground carbon sequestration, while climate mainly influences soil carbon sequestration most. The results of the analysis may be used to inform practitioners and policy makers on the most effective agroforestry system for carbon sequestration. The lack of data on carbon stocks before the implementation land use change and the lack of reporting on soil sampling design and variances were the main limitations in the data. The need to report this data should be considered in future studies if agroforestry systems are expected to play an important role as a climate change mitigation strategy.","Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.11.032' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.agee.2017.11.032</a>",,"What is the effectiveness of agroforestry systems for increasing soil and aboveground carbon sequestration?",3,2,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,2,3,3,"Evidence Review"

In detail, compared to NM, PM resulted in a 2-113% increase in yield-scaled GHG emissions, which was lower in semi-arid regions with medium and high N inputs. For PM systems, yield-scaled GHG emissions in medium N input decreased by 19-31% compared to high N input. Importantly, the yield-scaled GHG emissions in maize was always lower than in wheat. In future, in order to achieve global food and environmental security, it may be advisable to adopt PM in semi-arid regions with medium N input, especially for maize production, based on managing the tradeoffs among yield increase, yield-scaled GHG emissions, and increase in yield-scaled GHG emissions.

W.",2018,"Agricultural soils play an important role in the atmospheric methane (CH4) budget, where paddy soils can contribute significant CH4 to atmosphere whereas upland soils may act as a source or sink of atmospheric CH4, dependent on soil water conditions. Biochar amendments have effects on soil CH4 production or oxidation processes in individual experiments, but the causative mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. To synthesize the response of soil CH4 release or uptake to biochar amendment, we performed a meta-analysis using data from 61 peer-reviewed papers with 222 updated paired measurements. When averaged across all studies, biochar amendment significantly decreased CH4 release rates by 12% for paddy soils and 72% for upland soils, and CH4 uptake rates by 84% for upland soils. Neither soil CH4 release nor uptake responses to biochar amendment were significant in field soils. Nitrogen (N) fertilizer application would weaken the response of soil CH4 release or uptake to biochar amendment. Biochar-incurred decreases in soil CH4 release and uptake rates were the largest in medium-textured soils or neutral-pH soils. Soil CH4 release or uptake responses to biochar were also significantly altered by biochar characteristics, such as feedstock source, C/N ratio, pH, and pyrolysis temperature. The results of this synthesis suggest that the role of biochar in soil CH4 mitigation potential might have been exaggerated, particularly in fields when biochar is applied in combination with N fertilizer.",Ecosystems,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-018-0248-y' target='_blank'>10.1007/s10021-018-0248-y</a>",,"What are the effects of biochar amendment on soil methane release and uptake?",3,2,3,2,2,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,3,"Evidence Review"

The C sequestration potential of the world's cropland soil is 0.4-0.8 Pg soil C year(-1), which may be achieved through the adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs), including fertilizer management. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the influence of long-term application of different fertilizers and straw retention on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, to compare the calculated response ratios with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-recommended default relative stock change factors, and to propose recommendations for enhancing SOC sequestration. The meta-analysis indicated that the long-term application of chemical fertilizers (CF), organic fertilizers (OF), combined chemical and organic fertilizers (CFOF), and straw return (SR) significantly enhanced the SOC storage. Response ratios varied significantly (p < 0.05) across different fertilization measures and climatic zones, and was sensitive to the initial SOC content. The mean response ratio was 0.94 for no fertilizer (NF), 1.08 for CF, 1.48 for OF, 1.38 for CFOF, and 1.28 for SR. When IPCC default values for response ratios were applied, SOC storage with OF and CFOF treatments in warm temperate regions with a dry climate was underestimated by 26%, and in the cool temperate region with a moist climate was overestimated by 25% (p < 0.05). Analysis showed that sustained application of organic fertilizers and straw return could be a beneficial measures to mitigate climate change and ensure food security in China.

A.; Zhao, J. Y.; Donner, S. D.",2018,"Interventions that promote pro-environmental behaviours are increasingly necessary in reducing use of high-emissions goods and services to meet international climate change targets. Here we assess the greenhouse gas emissions reductions associated with behavioural interventions in three high-emitting domains (personal vehicle use, meat consumption, and household energy use) based on an analysis of the peer-reviewed literature. We examined 40 studies from 1991-2018 involving 886 576 subjects. We found that some of the most robust interventions shown to reduce emissions were financial incentives for personal vehicles, defaults for reduced meat consumption, and feedback for home energy use. We estimate mean annual reductions of 571 kgCO(2)e per vehicle driver for reduced vehicle use, 51 kgCO(2)e per individual for reduced meat consumption, and 149 kgCO(2)e per household for reduced energy use. Despite substantial attention to behavioural interventions in the literature, we find that few studies are suitable for quantifying emissions reductions (N = 6 for diet, N = 5 for personal vehicles) and few (N = 3) are conducted outside OECD countries. Due to this imbalance in the literature, we focus our findings on western economies. We find substantial variation in the emission reductions achieved with different interventions within each domain; interventions in diet ranged from reductions of 231 kgCO(2)e to increases of 116 kgCO(2)e per person per year (both statistically significant). Further, emissions reductions are sensitive to external factors, such as the emissions intensity of the electrical grid, which may change over time. Key gaps in the literature include a lack of studies conducted using randomized controlled trials or follow-ups, and in high-impact areas for emissions reductions including air travel. We highlight promising areas of intervention, such as habit changes to promote mode shifts in personal transportation, which would benefit from an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions reductions in future research.","Environmental Research Letters","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aae5d7' target='_blank'>10.1088/1748-9326/aae5d7</a>",,"How effective are behavioural interventions to reduce driving, meat consumption, and household energy use for reducing greenhouse gas emissions?",2,2,3,2,2,1,3,2,1,2,3,1,2,2,2,3,"Evidence Review"

Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of 84 published studies to examine the general responses of CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes to altered precipitation. Our results indicated that increased precipitation significantly increased N2O emissions (+154.0%) and CO2 fluxes (+112.2%) and significantly decreased CH4 uptake (-41.4%); decreased precipitation significantly decreased N2O emissions (-64.7%) and CO2 fluxes (-8.6%) and significantly increased CH4 uptake (+32.4%). Moreover, increased precipitation significantly increased litter biomass and microbial biomass and decreased root biomass and the root: shoot ratio. However, decreased precipitation significantly decreased litter biomass and root biomass and significantly increased root: shoot ratio. These results suggest that precipitation changes could alter the carbon distribution patterns in plants. In addition, the CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes exhibited diverse responses to different ecosystems, durations of precipitation changes, and changes in precipitation intensity. These results demonstrate that there are many factors that regulate the responses of GHG to precipitation changes.","Canadian Journal of Soil Science","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2018-0002' target='_blank'>10.1139/cjss-2018-0002</a>",,"What is the effect of precipitation intensity and duration on soil greenhouse gas fluxes?",3,2,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,3,"Evidence Review"
125712,"Global effects of plant litter alterations on soil CO2 to the atmosphere","Chen, XinLi; Chen, H. Y. H.",2018,"Soil respiration (Rs) is the largest terrestrial carbon (C) efflux to the atmosphere and is predicted to increase drastically through global warming. However, the responses of Rs to global warming are complicated by the fact that terrestrial plant growth and the subsequent input of plant litter to soil are also altered by ongoing climate change and human activities. Despite a number of experiments established in various ecosystems around the world, it remains a challenge to predict the magnitude and direction of changes in Rs and its temperature sensitivity (Q10) due to litter alteration. We present a meta-analysis of 100 published studies to examine the responses of Rs and Q10 to manipulated aboveground and belowground litter alterations. We found that 100% aboveground litter addition (double litter) increased Rs by 26.1% (95% confident intervals, 18.4%-33.7%), whereas 100% aboveground litter removal, root removal and litter + root removal reduced Rs by 22.8% (18.5%-27.1%), 34.1% (27.2%-40.9%) and 43.4% (36.6%-50.2%) respectively. Moreover, the effects of aboveground double litter and litter removal on Rs increased with experimental duration, but not those of root removal. Aboveground litter removal marginally increased Q10 by 6.2% (0.2%-12.3%) because of the higher temperature sensitivity of stable C substrate than fresh litter. Estimated from the studies that simultaneously tested the responses of Rs to aboveground litter addition and removal and assuming negligible changes in root-derived Rs, 'priming effect' on average accounted for 7.3% (0.6%-14.0%) of Rs and increased over time. Across the global variation in terrestrial ecosystems, the effects of aboveground litter removal, root removal, litter+root removal on Rs as well as the positive effect of litter removal on Q10 increased with water availability. Our meta-analysis indicates that priming effects should be considered in predicting Rs to climate change-induced increases in litterfall. Our analysis also highlights the need to incorporate spatial climate gradient in projecting long-term Rs responses to litter alterations.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14147' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.14147</a>",,"What are the effects of aboveground and belowground plant litter alterations on soil respiration and temperature sensitivity?",3,2,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,3,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"

S.; Lamare, M.",2018,"Most marine organisms present an indirect lifecycle where a planktonic larval stage reaches competency before settling to the substrate and metamorphosing. Despite the critical importance of these early life history stages, little is known about how global change-related stressors, in particular ocean acidification (OA), affect marine larval settlement and metamorphosis. To date, 48 studies have investigated the effects of OA on larval settlement, focussing mostly on tropical corals (16), echinoderms (11) and fish (8). Most studies show negative effects of OA during settlement and post-settlement processes. For instance, reduced settlement is typically seen along natural pH gradients and in experimentally lowered pH treatments. This generally results in reduced settlement selectivity and metamorphosis and poorer post-settlement fitness. Carryover effects of OA exposure can also occur, with larval environmental history influencing early post-settlement performance. We conclude that OA may (1) alter larval supply for settlement by altering horizontal swimming be haviour or vertical migration; (2) directly influence settlement success through changes in the nature and distribution of suitable settlement substrates (e.g. biofilm, crustose coralline algae); and (3) mediate carryover effects at settlement by altering larval development or larval energy budgets. In contrast to fish larvae, there is little evidence for most invertebrate larvae that their perception of settlement cues is directly influenced by reduced pH. A summation of how OA affects the settlement and metamorphosis of marine invertebrates is timely, since altered settlement rates will influence the future distributions, abundances and ecology of marine benthic communities.","Marine Ecology Progress Series","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps12754' target='_blank'>10.3354/meps12754</a>",,"What are the effects of ocean acidification on the settlement and metamorphosis of marine invertebrate and fish larvae?",2,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,"Evidence Review"

Our knowledge of the effects of elevated anthropogenic CO2 in marine waters and its effect on the performance of single species, trophic interactions, and ecosystems is increasing rapidly. However, our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients such as nitrogen is less advanced and lacks a comprehensive overview of how these processes may change under OA. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of eight major nitrogen transformation processes incorporating 49 publications to synthesize current scientific understanding of the effect of OA on nitrogen cycling in the future ocean by 2100. The following points were identified by our meta-analysis: (a) Diazotrophic nitrogen fixation is likely enhanced by 29% +/- 4% under OA; (b) species- and strain-specific responses of nitrogen fixers to OA were detectable, which may result in alterations in microbial community composition in the future ocean; (c) nitrification processes were reduced by a factor of 29% +/- 10%; (d) declines in nitrification rates were not reflected by nitrifier abundance; and (e) contrasting results in unispecific culture experiments versus natural communities were apparent for nitrogen fixation and denitrification. The net effect of the nitrogen cycle process responses also suggests there may be a shift in the relative nitrogen pools, with excess ammonium originating from CO2-fertilized diazotrophs. This regenerated inorganic nitrogen may recycle in the upper water column increasing the relative importance of the ammonium-fueled regenerated production. However, several feedback mechanisms with other chemical cycles, such as oxygen, and interaction with other climate change stressors may counteract these findings. Finally, our review highlights the shortcomings and gaps in current understanding of the potential changes in nitrogen cycling under future climate and emphasizes the need for further ecosystem studies.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14424' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.14424</a>",,"What is the effect of ocean acidification on the marine nitrogen cycle?",2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,1,3,2,1,3,2,2,3,"Evidence Review"

Although this hypothesis was supported by a recent meta-analysis, we believe that the meta-analytic calculation used was not appropriate to test the stated hypothesis. Here, we first clarify the hypothesis put forward, the crux being that the effects of increased food supply and CO2 interact statistically. We then test this hypothesis by examining the available data in a more appropriate analytical framework. Using factorial meta-analysis, we confirm that food addition has a positive effect and CO2 has a negative effect on both growth and calcification. For calcification, food addition did indeed reduce CO2 impacts. Surprisingly, however, we found that food addition actually exacerbated the effects of acidification on growth, perhaps due to increased scope upon which CO2 effects can act in food-replete situations. These interactive effects were undetectable using a multilevel meta-analytic approach. Ongoing changes in food supply and carbonate chemistry, coupled with under-described, poorly understood, and potentially surprising interactive outcomes for these two variables, suggest that the role of food should remain a priority in ocean acidification research.","Scientific Reports","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-28012-w' target='_blank'>10.1038/s41598-018-28012-w</a>","physiological energetics; seawater acidification; response ratios; metaanalysis; availability; impacts; allocation; resistance; survival; co2; Science &amp; Technology - Other Topics","What are the effects of increased food supply on calcification and growth of marine organisms?",2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,3,2,2,1,"Evidence Review"

In marine systems, saltmarsh, seagrass, and mangrove habitats-collectively known as 'blue carbon' and coastal vegetated habitats (CVHs)-are a leading sequester of global C and increasingly impacted by exotic species invasions. There is growing interest in the effect of invasion by a diverse pool of exotic species on C storage and the implications for ecosystem-based management of these systems. In a global meta-analysis, we synthesized data from 104 papers that provided 345 comparisons of habitat-level response (plant and soil C storage) from paired invaded and uninvaded sites. We found an overall net effect of significantly higher C pools in invaded CVHs amounting to 40% (+/- 16%) higher C storage than uninvaded habitat, but effects differed among types of invaders. Elevated C storage was driven by blue C-forming plant invaders (saltmarsh grasses, seagrasses, and mangrove trees) that intensify biomass per unit area, extend and elevate coastal wetlands, and convert coastal mudflats into C-rich vegetated habitat. Introduced animal and structurally distinct primary producers had significant negative effects on C pools, driven by herbivory, trampling, and native species displacement. The role of invasion manifested differently among habitat types, with significant C storage increases in saltmarshes, decreases in seagrass, and no significant effect in mangroves. There were also counter-directional effects by the same species in different systems or locations, which underscores the importance of combining data mining with analyses of mean effect sizes in meta-analyses. Our study provides a quantitative basis for understanding differential effects of invasion on blue C habitats and will inform conservation strategies that need to balance management decisions involving invasion, C storage, and a range of other marine biodiversity and habitat functions in these coastal systems.","Global Change Biology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14426' target='_blank'>10.1111/gcb.14426</a>",,"What are the effects of biological invasions on carbon pools in coastal vegetated habitats (saltmarsh, seagrass, and mangrove habitats)?",3,2,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,2,"Evidence Review"

We used a generalized linear mixed effect model to evaluate the effect of land use change (forest versus pasture), soil depth, and original native forest types. The model showed that there was a significant reduction in SOC stocks due to the conversion of native forests to pasturelands. The median loss of SOC ranged from 31.6% to 52.0% depending upon the soil depth. The highest loss was observed in tropical mangrove forests followed by highland tropical forests and humid tropical forests. Higher loss was detected in upper soil horizon (0-30 cm) compared to deeper horizons.

Such trade-offs are regulated by climate fluctuations and heterogeneous soil conditions and have not been well addressed. Supporting CSA management decisions requires advancing our understanding of how NT affects crop yield and GHG emissions in different agroecological regions.

Compared to conventional tillage (CT), NT reduced in GHG emissions and increased crop yield in dry, but not humid, climates, and reduced in the GWP at sites with acidic soils. Across different cropping systems, NT enhanced barley yield by 49%, particularly in dry climates, and it decreased the GWP of rice fields through a 22% reduction in both CO2 and CH4 emissions. Our synthesis suggests that NT is an effective CSA management practice because of its potential for climate change mitigation and crop yield improvement.

However, the magnitude of manure application impacts on SOC changes as compared with conventional mineral fertilizers still needs to be better assessed. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to address the effects of various fertilization practices on SOC changes in China's arable topsoil. The analysis was based on 148 peer reviewed articles reporting 69 sites and 729 observations with an average experimental duration of 18 years across China. We compared the response of SOC content to application of manure alone (M) or manure plus mineral fertilizers (NPKM) with the SOC response to NPK or no fertilizers (Control). We systematically analyzed how SOC responses were influenced by different environmental and management factors (land use, climate and soil properties, etc.). First, the retention coefficient of manure was used to present the percentage of C input from manure 'converted' to SOC. Compared to Control, on average, manure had C-retention coefficients of 31%±12% (95% Confidence Interval, CI) and 18%±2% for the experimental duration of ≤10 years and >10 years, respectively. When compared to NPK, manure had C-retention coefficients of 29%±13% and 9%±3% for the experimental duration of ≤10 years and >10 years, respectively.

With this review, we aimed to investigate the importance of temperature on reproductive phenophase transitions (i.e., maturation and release of propagules) of temperate seaweeds while discussing how global warming might affect their reproductive phenology. A systematic literature search returned a total of 81 relevant papers, which were reviewed for evidence of environmental, factors (including temperature) driving reproductive phenology. Only a few of studies reported effects of temperature on propagule release (spores and gametes). In contrast, reproductive maturation (both sporogenesis and gametogenesis) was found predominantly to be controlled by temperature. Our findings highlight the potential for phenological shifts in seaweeds in response to ocean warming. In contrast to the consistent advancement of spring events observed for terrestrial plants, there was evidence that warming can both advance and delay the timing of reproductive events for temperate seaweeds, especially the maturation of propagules. Because temperature was often found to act in combination with either day length or spectral composition, ocean warming might result in a mismatch between light and temperature requirements that could lead to reduced reproductive performance. © 2018 de Bettignies, Wernberg and Gurgel.","Frontiers in Marine Science","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2018.00218' target='_blank'>10.3389/fmars.2018.00218</a>","temperate macroalgae, life cycle, phenophase, sporogenesis, gametogenesis, reproduction, warming, herbarium data","What is the effect of temperature on the reproductive phenology of temperate seaweeds?",3,1,2,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,2,"Evidence Review"
125657,"Major perturbations in the Earth&#8217;s forest ecosystems. Possible implications for global warming","Prăvălie, R.",2018,"Forests are among the most important terrestrial ecological systems in terms of the multitude of ecosystem functions and services they provide. These biotic systems are vital not only for ensuring the wellbeing of human society and for preserving global biodiversity, but also for regulating the climate system, decarbonizing the atmosphere via carbon sequestration (in biomass or underlying soil carbon pools) and evaporative cooling processes that mitigate climate warming. However, forest ecosystems are currently being subjected to a wide range of natural and anthropic disturbances that pose a real threat not only to forest health and the various benefits forests provide for human society, but also to the overall functioning of the global system. This paper is a review that aims to analyse, in a brief and holistic manner, the main perturbations Earth forest ecosystems are currently facing, both the obvious (e.g. deforestation) and discrete/silent ones (e.g. defaunation) that have generally not yet been tackled strictly as ecological forest issues in the international scientific literature. At the same time, the paper aims to highlight the possible effects generated by forest perturbations in the global warming process, through carbon fluxes and biogeophysical feedbacks between these terrestrial systems and the atmosphere. Upon analysis of a vast scientific bibliography, it was found there currently are 12 major forest disturbances that can be grouped into three categories based on the prevalence of triggering causes, i.e. climatic (phenological shifts, range shifts, die-off events, insect infestations), anthropic (deforestation, fragmentation, air pollution) and mixed (defaunation, fires, composition shifts, net primary productivity shifts, biogeochemical shifts) perturbations. These ecological issues, which occur frequently, intensely and on large spatial scales, are able to significantly disrupt forest productivity and therefore strongly erode the forests'capacity to stabilize the climate system. All identified disturbances can amplify global warming in various ways, including by means of many positive feedback mechanisms in the case of climatic perturbations. Finally, this review paper proposes five major anthropogenic strategies to fight this multidimensional forest crisis – mitigate, adapt, repair, protect and research actions, which, if implemented rapidly, efficiently and on a large scale via international policies, can successfully stabilize these terrestrial ecosystems and, implicitly, the climate system in the 21st century. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Earth-Science Reviews","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.06.010' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.06.010</a>","Forest perturbations, ecosystem functions and services, carbon sequestration, climate warming, positive feedbacks.","What are the effcts of major perturbations in the Earth's forest ecosystems on carbon fluxes and biogeophysical feedbacks between these terrestrial systems and the atmosphere?",2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,"Evidence Review"

Calculations of N2O emission factors from land uses are currently based on a single, universal BNE value advocated by the International Panel on Climate Change, but BNE are thought to vary with climate and soil types. We ran a meta-analysis of 58 peer-reviewed, published data source on soil BNE from cropland fields across China, representing a range of climate and soil types. Mean soil BNE rate in croplands was estimated at 0.93 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and varied among the climatic zones, where the highest rate was in the north subtropical zone (1.66 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and the lowest in the cold temperate zone (0.53 kg N ha-1 yr-1). We estimated total national BNE for China based on the BNE rates for the different climatic zones and found it to be 129 Gg N yr-1; this estimate was higher than the estimate of 114 Gg N yr-1 derived from using only a single national average BNE rate. Stepwise multiple regression modelling of soil BNE rate (kg N ha-1 yr-1) with soil properties and climatic parameters, including soil bulk density, mean annual precipitation, soil total nitrogen, and soil pH showed that soil bulk density had the greatest influence on the BNE rate.

The yield measure used is above ground dry weight and is evaluated across pasture and forage species from different plant functional groups. The results of the meta-analysis showed that +C will increase plant growth across Europe, with shrubs experiencing a larger increase than other functional groups, increased temperature (+T) will increase plant growth in Alpine and northern areas but will decrease it in continental Europe.

To quantify the relative soil C contribution from trees in agroforestry systems (AFS), this study assessed the reported differences in SOC stocks under agroforestry systems in comparison with other land-use systems (Agriculture, Forestry, Pasture, or Uncultivated Land) in various soil-depth classes in four agroecological regions (arid and semiarid, ASA; lowland humid tropics, LHT; Mediterranean, MED; and temperate, TEM) around the world. Using mixed-effect models and a meta-analytical approach, we synthesized data from 78 peer-reviewed studies that generated 858 data points (sites) on SOC stock under various AFS practiced globally. Comparing Agroforest vs. Agriculture or Agroforest vs. Pasture, SOC stocks under AFS were higher by +27% in the ASA region, +26% in LHT, and +5.8% in TEM, but -5.3% in the TEM in the 0-100 cm soil depth. The Agroforest aged between 10-20 years had higher SOC stock than newly established, as well as &lt;10-year-old systems across all soil-depth classes and agroecological regions. Overall, Agroforest vs. Agriculture land management practices resulted in positive SOC stock changes within AFS up to 100 cm soil depth, whereas SOC stock under AFS was lower than under Forest. The results suggest that a general pattern of Forest - Agroforest - Agriculture - Pasture continuum could be expected in SOC stock decline during land-use changes. Improvement of SOC stocks under AFS varied across agroecological regions, the highest being under arid and semiarid region, closely followed by the low humid tropics.

Restoration often involves mechanical thinning to promote development of complex habitats in moist, productive forests and mechanical thinning with prescribed fire to reduce fuels and restore natural disturbance regimes in dry, fire prone forests. This systematic review quantified the impact of restoration treatments on forest ecosystem carbon (C) stocks and identified factors that moderate treatment effects across spatial and temporal scales. Our review process identified 73 studies to be included for analysis, from which we calculated 482 estimates of treatment effect size. We found that restoration treatments significantly reduce C. Prescribed fire had larger impacts on belowground than aboveground carbon pools, while thinning and combined treatments had larger impacts on aboveground pools. The available literature is highly skewed toward shorter timescales (<25 years after treatment), small spatial scales, and is geographically concentrated: 41% of estimated effect sizes came from studies in the Sierra Nevada. Thinning had similar effects on forest carbon in dry forests and moist forests. The relative magnitude of total C losses was significantly less from simulation than empirical studies, although simulations also mostly evaluated long-term impacts (>75 years after treatment) while empirical studies mostly looked at short term (<25 year) effects. Post-treatment wildfire significantly reduced the percentage of carbon lost relative to controls in the aboveground pool. Long-term, treated stands only recovered to control levels of carbon when wildfire was present. Returns on the carbon debt imposed by thinning and prescribed fire depend on the nuances of the treatments themselves but may also depend upon treatment intensity and the frequency and intensity of future wildfire.

125612,"A review of life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of commonly used ex-situ soil treatment technologies","Amponsah, Nana Y.; Wang, Junye; Zhao, Lian",2018,"GHG emissions are important footprints because of increasing concern over climate change. Remediation methods produces GHGs in varying quantities based on which activities are involved through its entire life cycle and which contaminants are present, often because some contaminants are more difficult to remove from soil than others. Accounting for emissions from all phases of the project requires a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. LCA can help in choosing the best available technology to reduce the environmental burden of the remediation technology or to improve the sustainability of the technology by implementing systematic approaches to ensure that future developments are optimized for environmental performance throughout the life cycle. The primary objective of this paper is to review existing LCA studies that report GHG emissions (CO2-eq) or Global warming potential (GWP) from six ex situ soil remediation technologies (ESRTs), including excavation and disposal, ex-situ thermal desorption, ex-situ soil vapor extraction, ex-situ bioremediation, excavation and incineration, and soil washing, and present the variability in GHG/GWP results and how this data can help in selecting an ex-situ soil remediation technology with a lower global warming potential. A second objective of this study is to compare the GWP levels of ex-situ remediation to the GWP levels of typical in situ remediation methods. Our results showed a large variation in GHG emissions of treated soil from six ESRTs varying from 3.1 x 10(-7) t to 8.2 t CO2-eq/m(3). Incineration had the highest mean GHG emissions (0.7 t CO2-eq/m(3)) and thermal desorption the lowest (0.07 t CO2-eq/m(3)). It was also found that there was a large variation range of GHG emissions from the ex-situ excavation and disposal method soil treatment technologies, varying from 3.1 x 10(-7) t to 8.2 t CO2-eq/m(3) of treated soil. This knowledge provides opportunities to increase sustainability of soil remediation throughout the investigation, design, construction, operation, and monitoring phases of site remediation regardless of the selected cleanup remedy.

Beneficial management practices such as enrichment planting and the application of soil amendments can affect C sequestration and GHG emissions in agroforestry systems; however, such effects are not well understood. A literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the prospects for enhancing C sequestration and reducing GHG emissions through enrichment (i.e., in-fill) tree planting, a common practice in improving stand density within existing forests, and the application of organic amendments to soils. Our review indicates that in agroforests only a few studies have examined the effect of enrichment planting, which has been reported to increase C storage in plant biomass. The effect of adding organic amendments such as biochar, compost and manure to soil on enhancing C sequestration and reducing GHG emissions is well documented, but primarily in conventional crop production systems. Within croplands, application of biochar derived from various feedstocks, has been shown to increase soil organic C content, reduce CO2 and N2O emissions, and increase CH4 uptake, as compared to no application of biochar. Depending on the feedstock used to produce biochar, biochar application can reduce N2O emission by 3% to 84% as compared to no addition of biochars. On the other hand, application of compost emits less CO2 and N2O as compared to the application of manure, while the application of pelleted manure leads to more N2O emission compared to the application of raw manure. In summary, enrichment planting and application of organic soil amendments such as compost and biochar will be better options than the application of raw manure for enhancing C sequestration and reducing GHG emissions. However, there is a shortage of data to support these practices in the field, and thus further research on the effect of these two areas of management intervention on C cycling will be imperative to developing best management practices to enhance C sequestration and minimize GHG emissions from agroforestry systems.",FORESTS,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f9060369' target='_blank'>10.3390/f9060369</a>","climate change, manuring, manure pelleting, northern temperate, pyrolysis, information review","What are the effects of Enrichment Planting and Soil Amendments on Carbon Sequestration and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Agroforestry Systems?",3,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,"Evidence Review"

These experiments have inspired a body of theoretical work to explain the variation in the effect of warming on top-down control. However, there has been no quantitative attempt to reconcile theory with outcomes from empirical studies. To address the gap between theory and experiment, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the combined effect of experimental warming and top-down control on resource biomass and determined potential sources of variation across experiments. We show that differences in experimental outcomes are related to systematic variation in the geographical distribution of studies. Specifically, warming strengthened top-down control when experiments were conducted in colder regions, but had the opposite effect in warmer regions. Furthermore, we found that differences in the thermoregulation strategy of the consumer and openness of experimental arenas to dispersal can contribute to some deviation from the overall geographical pattern.

Much of the extant research examines how changes in climate lead to changes in primary production; however, few studies consider how climate change translates into industry-wide impacts and economic consequences across the sugarcane value chain. Of the 90 studies we reviewed (published as journal articles, proceedings, and book chapters), 61 assess observed and/or projected impacts of climate change on sugarcane production. These studies reach largely different conclusions regarding how increases in air temperature or atmospheric carbon dioxide levels impact sugarcane production. These mixed results can be attributed to differences between the studies in terms of methods, time frames, and growing regions, which all limit cross-study comparability.

This study meets the call for addressing how life-history traits mediate effects of ocean acidification on fish. We built a database of overall and trait-mediated responses of teleost fish to future CO2 levels by searching the scientific literature. Using a meta-analytical approach, we investigated the effects of projected CO2 levels by IPCC for 2050-2070 and 2100 on fish eco-physiology and behavior from 320 contrasts on 42 species, stemming from polar to tropical regions. Moreover, since organisms may experience a mosaic of carbonate chemistry in coastal environments (e.g., in estuaries, upwelling zones and intertidal habitats), which may have higher pCO(2) values than open ocean waters, we assessed responses from additional 103 contrasts on 21 fish species using pCO(2) levels well above IPCC projections. Under mid-century and end-of-century CO2 emission scenarios, we found multiple CO2-dose-dependent effects on calcification, resting metabolic rate, yolk, and behavioral performances, along with increased predation risk and decreased foraging, particularly for larvae. Importantly, many of the traits considered will not confer fish tolerance to elevated CO2 and far-reaching ecological consequences on fish population replenishment and community structure will likely occur. Extreme CO2 levels well above IPCC projections showed effects on fish mortality and calcification, while growth, metabolism, and yolk were unaffected. CO2 exposures in short-term experiments increased fish mortality, which in turn decreased in longer-term exposures. Whatever the elevated CO2 levels considered, some key biological processes (e.g., reproduction, development, habitat choice) were critically understudied. Fish are an important resource for livelihoods in coastal communities and a key component for stability of marine ecosystems. Given the multiple trait-mediated effects evidenced here, we stress the need to fill the knowledge gap on important eco-physiological processes and to expand the number and duration of ocean acidification studies to multi-generational, multiple stressor (e.g., warming, hypoxia, fishing), and species interactions experiments to better elucidate complex ecosystem-level changes and how these changes might alter provisioning of ecosystem services.","ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1297' target='_blank'>10.1002/ecm.1297</a>","behavior; calcification; development; fish traits; growth; heterogeneity; metabolism; survival; teleosts","What are the effects of ocean acidification on ecophysiology and behaviour of teleost fish?",3,2,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,3,2,2,2,"Evidence Review"
125577,"Dynamics of soil carbon and nitrogen stocks after afforestation in arid and semi-arid regions: A meta-analysis","Liu, X.; Yang, T.; Wang, Q.; Huang, F.; Li, L.",2018,"Arid and semi-arid regions store approximately 27% of global soil organic carbon (SOC), thus playing an important role in the global carbon cycle. Although afforestation is widely used to achieve the goals of landscape protection and ecological restoration in these regions, its effects on the dynamics of SOC and total nitrogen (TN) stocks as well as the related controlling factors are still poorly understood. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted by compiling results from published studies to evaluate the influences of afforestation on dynamics of SOC and TN stocks in mineral soils (0–30 cm) in arid and semi-arid regions, and to examine whether the changes in SOC and TN stocks were influenced by prior land-use, planted tree species and plantation age. The results showed that overall, afforestation significantly increased SOC stock by 131% and TN stock by 88%. Prior land-use was found to be the most important factor that influenced the dynamics of SOC and TN stocks following afforestation. Significantly larger increases in SOC and TN stocks were observed after barren land afforestation in comparison to cropland and grassland afforestation. The accumulations in SOC and TN stocks after afforestation decreased in the following order: broadleaf deciduous forests > coniferous forests > broadleaf evergreen forests. However, significant differences in SOC and TN accumulations were only detected between broadleaf deciduous forests and broadleaf evergreen forests. Plantation age did not affect the dynamics of SOC and TN stocks after afforestation, mainly due to the rapid accumulations in SOC and TN after barren land afforestation. The results indicate that afforestation, especially on barren land with broadleaf deciduous species, provides substantial opportunities for SOC and TN sequestrations in arid and semi-arid regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Science of the Total Environment","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.009

In a context of growing social awareness of the role of different dietary choices in the environment, the review of different alternatives on the road to a healthy and sustainable diet should integrate relevant information on the nutritional quality of different eating habits. Since dietary choices have an effect on environmental sustainability and human health, a literature review on different dietary choices has been conducted to determine the differences in carbon footprint and nutritional quality identifying the main hotspots trying to give advice towards the identification of sustainable diets. After applying a set of criteria for reference selection, 21 peer-reviewed studies have been analysed in detail, allowing the comparison of 66 dietary scenarios. We identified that the so-called Mediterranean and Atlantic diets present high nutritional scores and low carbon footprints. On the contrary, the dietary choices identified in northern and Western Europe, as well as in the United States, have the highest carbon footprints, highlighting the contribution of dairy products as a basic source of high-quality nutrients and protein. Broadly speaking, dietary choices rich in vegetables (e.g., vegan, vegetarian as well as Indian and Peruvian) have a better environmental profile than those rich in meat (mainly ruminant meat). In line with these findings, the shift in meat consumption habits from beef and veal to chicken, pork and poultry, the introduction of alternative foods to animal protein (e.g. quinoa) and the consumption of olive oil as a major source of vegetable oil may be compatible with a healthier and more environmentally friendly diet. However, the complete elimination of meat and dairy products from the daily diet may not be feasible in case the supply of some micronutrients (e.g., calcium and vitamin D) is not guaranteed. Limitations were identified in the consulted studies related to the consideration of the different system boundaries, as well as underlying uncertainties related to data sources. Therefore, efforts should be made to develop consistent and agreed-upon methods for estimating both the carbon footprint and nutritional quality scores. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

About 89% of this grassland C is stored in the soil and is affected by management activities but the effects of these management activities on C storage under different climate settings are not known. In this study, we synthesized the effects of fertilizer (nitrogen and phosphorus) application, liming and grazing regime on the stock of SOC in global grasslands, under different site specific climatic settings using a meta-analysis of 341 datasets. We found an overall significant reduction (-8.5%) in the stock of SOC in global managed grasslands, mainly attributable to grazing (-15.0%), and only partially attenuated by fertilizer addition (+6.7%) and liming (+5.8%), indicating that management to improve biomass production does not contribute sufficient organic matter to replace that lost by direct removal by animals. Management activities had the greatest effect in the tropics (-22.4%) due primarily to heavy grazing, and the least effect in the temperate zone (-4.5%). The negative management effect reduced significantly with increasing mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation in the temperate zone, suggesting that temperate grassland soils are potential C sinks in the face of climate change. For a sustainable management of grasslands that will provide adequate forage for livestock and mitigate climate change through C sequestration, we recommend that future tropical grassland management policies should focus on reducing the intensity of grazing. Also, to verify our findings for temperate grasslands and to better inform land management policy, future research should focus on the impacts of the projected climate change on net greenhouse gas exchange and potential climate feedbacks.","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.06.013' target='_blank'>10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.06.013</a>","Grassland soils, Soil improvement, Land management, Climate change, Carbon sequestration, Nitrogen amendment","What is the effect of inorganic fertilizers, liming and grazing on soil organic carbon stock in grasslands?",3,2,2,2,3,1,2,2,1,3,2,1,3,3,2,1,"Evidence Review"

Recent studies have suggested that experimental ocean acidification (OA) can alter the feeding performance of marine calcifying invertebrates, but results have been inconsistent. While several reviews pertaining to the biological effects of OA exist, none provide a synthesis of OA effects on feeding performance. Here, we provide a quantitative analysis of published experiments testing for effects of elevated CO2 on feeding rates of marine calcifying invertebrates. Results revealed that suspension-feeding molluscs and predatory and grazing echinoderms experienced depressed feeding rates under elevated CO2, while arthropods appeared unaffected; larval and juvenile animals were more susceptible to CO2 effects than adults. Feeding strategy did not appear to influence the overall taxonomic trend, nor did habitat, although exposure time did have an effect. AIC model selection revealed that Phylum best predicted effect size; life stage and exposure time were also included in candidate models. Based on these results, we synthesize potential physiological attributes of different taxa that may drive OA sensitivities in feeding rates, which could potentially result in community-level impacts.

However, there has been no quantitative analysis on the effect of conservation agriculture, particularly in relation to crop residue retention, on soil microbial biomass C (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic), and the microbial quotient (qMIC, Cmic-to-organic C ratio), which are frequently used as indicators of soil health under different agricultural practices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of conservation agriculture practices on soil Cmic, Nmic and qMIC on a global scale using meta-analysis based on data from 96 recent publications. Relative to conventional tillage (CT) without residue retention, NT without residue retention (NTR0) increased Cmic by 33% (P &lt; 0.05), while NT with residue retention (NTR) increased (P &lt; 0.05) Cmic, Nmic, and qMIC by 25, 64, and 57%, respectively. Greater Cmic and Nmic were found in the NT than in the CT treatment, regardless of the soil condition (e.g., soil pH and texture), experimental duration, and climate (e.g., mean annual temperature and precipitation). Particularly, NTR was a promising conservation agriculture practice to increase Cmic and Nmic in global farmlands, and NTR0 can be an alternate strategy for loam soils in the subhumid (600–1000 mm mean annual precipitation) region, or under long-term (&gt;20 yr) conservation agriculture practices. We conclude that NTR should be an important strategy that could be used to increase Cmic and Nmic contents and improve soil quality in global farmlands. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.02.024

125541,"Physiological implications of ocean acidification for marine fish: emerging patterns and new insights","Esbaugh, A.J.",2018,"Ocean acidification (OA) is an impending environmental stress facing all marine life, and as such has been a topic of intense research interest in recent years. Numerous detrimental effects have been documented in marine fish, ranging from reduced mortality to neurosensory impairment, and the prevailing opinions state that these effects are largely the downstream consequences of altered blood carbon dioxide chemistry caused by respiratory acid–base disturbances. While the respiratory acid–base disturbances are consistent responses to OA across tested fish species, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is wide variability in the degree of downstream impairments between species. This can also be extended to intraspecies variability, whereby some individuals have tolerant physiological traits, while others succumb to the effects of OA. This review will synthesize relevant literature on marine fish to highlight consistent trends of impairment, as well as observed interspecies variability in the responses to OA, and the potential routes of physiological acclimation. In all cases, whole animal responses are linked to demonstrated or proposed physiological impairments. Major topics of focus include: (1) respiratory acid–base disturbances; (2) early life survival and growth; (3) the implications for metabolic performance, activity, and reproduction; and (4) emerging physiological theories pertaining to neurosensory impairment and the role of GABAA receptors. Particular emphasis is placed on the importance of understanding the underlying physiological traits that confer inter- and intraspecies tolerance, as the abundance of these traits will decide the long-term outlook of marine fish. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Journal of Comparative Physiology B: Biochemical, Systemic, and Environmental Physiology","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00360-017-1105-6

125542,"Potential impacts of climate change on vegetable production and product quality – A review","Bisbis, M.B.; Gruda, N.; Blanke, M.",2018,"This paper reviews climate change impacts on the production, physiology, yield, and product quality of vegetables affected by shifting CO2 and O3 concentrations, precipitation and temperature conditions, as well as subjected to extreme weather events. The emphasis is on the temperate cool climate of Western Europe. Physiological processes such as respiration and photosynthesis can acclimate to increasing atmospheric CO2 and temperatures. The effect of increased CO2 on vegetables is mostly beneficial for production, but may alter internal product quality, or result in photosynthetic down-regulation. Heat stress reduces fruit set of fruiting vegetables, and speeds up development of determinate vegetables, shortening their time for photoassimilation. In both cases, yield losses result with an impaired product quality, thereby increasing production waste. A longer growing season, arising from warmer temperatures, allows a greater number of plantings to be cultivated, contributing to greater annual yields. However, some vegetables need a period of cold accumulation to produce a harvest. Despite the increasing potential for winter cultivation in the future, perennials like asparagus might increasingly suffer from a lack of winter chilling. In cauliflower, higher temperatures will likely cause insufficient vernalization delaying head induction. This review may contribute in improving the adaptation strategies of vegetable production to climate change for a sustainable horticulture due to an effective risk management by meeting the problems of possible waste increase; breeding of new heat, drought and pest tolerant cultivars; secure water resources; increase the use of renewable energy sources; stimulating new ideas in innovative technologies; development of new approaches to secure stable yields and improve the product quality of vegetables for a cleaner production. © Elsevier.

Many studies have explored the factors that affect the direction and extent of changes in soil C after different harvest residue management practices. However, the effect of soil properties, especially soil texture, on the difference in mineral soil C storage between harvest residue retention and removal treatment are still not fully understood. Using a meta-analysis approach, we investigated the factors that influence the change in mineral soil C stocks following stem-only harvest (SOH), when compared to whole-tree harvest (WTH). We found that the retention of harvest residues associated with the SOH treatment led to 8.2% greater soil C storage in 0–20 cm mineral soils, compared to the WTH treatment. Soil properties (soil clay content and C concentrations) were the most important factors mediating soil C response to residue retention. Relative to the WTH treatment, the SOH treatment showed smaller mineral soil C pools in some high clay content soils, possibly by increasing the mineralization of existing soil organic matter stocks via a priming mechanism. Climate was a poor predictor of differences in treatment effects, with no significant difference between temperate and tropical forests. There were no significant relationships between the treatment effect on mineral soil C and mean annual temperature or precipitation. Both coniferous and broadleaf forests exhibited a significantly higher mineral soil C storage in the 0–20 cm soil layer with the SOH relative to the WTH treatment. Compared to WTH treatment, the higher soil C contents in upper mineral soils after the SOH treatment appeared to last about one decade after harvesting.

The consequences of conversion from HT to mainly NT on soil organic carbon (SOC) have been subject to a number of meta-analyses revealing either a positive or non-significant effect. In this study, we used the equivalent soil mass (ESM) approach to evaluate SOC stock changes following the conversion from HT to IT and NT considering studies compiled within a systematic review. In order to maximize the use of available evidence, we used different substitution methods for imputing missing information on the variance of both SOC and bulk density (ρb). Based on a total of 101 long-term field trials (&gt; 10 years), the positive effect of IT and NT compared to HT was found to be limited to the topsoil (0–30 cm depth). Estimated SOC stock increases for this particular depth ranged from 3.22 ± 1.48 to 3.50 ± 1.60 (HT vs. IT) and 4.19 ± 1.82 to 4.23 ± 1.92 Mg ha− 1 (HT vs. NT). Calculating stocks based on fixed depth layers and without consideration of the equivalent soil mass, respectively, resulted in an overestimation of the increase with 15 (HT vs. IT) and 47% (HT vs. NT and IT vs. NT). Due to shallow sampling depth, HT vs. IT and IT vs. NT comparisons were limited to 0–30 cm depth, but the effect of HT to NT conversion could also be determined for 0–60 cm. The results indicate that the NT sequestration potential is overvalued when neglecting deeper depths, since the SOC storage capacity was reduced to &lt; 0.10 Mg ha− 1 yr− 1.

Intensive forest management and global climate change have had negative impacts on the quality of forest soils via soil acidification, reduction of soil organic carbon content, deterioration of soil biological properties, and reduction of soil biodiversity. The role of biochar in improving soil properties and the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been extensively documented in agricultural soils, while the effect of biochar application on forest soils remains poorly understood. Here, we review and summarize the available literature on the effects of biochar on soil properties and GHG emissions in forest soils. Materials and methods: This review focuses on (1) the effect of biochar application on soil physical, chemical, and microbial properties in forest ecosystems; (2) the effect of biochar application on soil GHG emissions in forest ecosystems; and (3) knowledge gaps concerning the effect of biochar application on biogeochemical and ecological processes in forest soils. Results and discussion: Biochar application to forests generally increases soil porosity, soil moisture retention, and aggregate stability while reducing soil bulk density. In addition, it typically enhances soil chemical properties including pH, organic carbon stock, cation exchange capacity, and the concentration of available phosphorous and potassium. Further, biochar application alters microbial community structure in forest soils, while the increase of soil microbial biomass is only a short-term effect of biochar application. Biochar effects on GHG emissions have been shown to be variable as reflected in significantly decreasing soil N2O emissions, increasing soil CH4 uptake, and complex (negative, positive, or negligible) changes of soil CO2 emissions. Moreover, all of the aforementioned effects are biochar-, soil-, and plant-specific. Conclusions: The application of biochars to forest soils generally results in the improvement of soil physical, chemical, and microbial properties while also mitigating soil GHG emissions. Therefore, we propose that the application of biochar in forest soils has considerable advantages, and this is especially true for plantation soils with low fertility. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Journal of Soils and Sediments","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1906-y

To overcome this challenge, rice production should be increased, albeit sustainably. However, since rice production is associated with increases in the atmospheric concentration of two greenhouse gases (GHGs), namely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), the challenge is on ensuring that production increases are not associated with an increase in GHG emissions and thus do not cause an increase in GHG emission intensities. Based on current understanding of drivers of CH4 and N2O production, we provide here insights on the potential climate change mitigation benefits of management and technological options (i.e., seeding, tillage, irrigation, residue management) pursued in the LAC region. Studies conducted in the LAC region show intermittent irrigation or alternate wetting and drying of rice fields to reduce CH4 emissions by 25-70% without increasing N2O emissions. Results on yield changes associated with intermittent irrigation remain inconclusive. Compared to conventional tillage, no-tillage and anticipated tillage (i.e., fall tillage) cause a 21% and 25% reduction in CH4 emissions, respectively. From existing literature, it was unambiguous that the mitigation potential of most management strategies pursued in the LAC region need to be quantified while acknowledging country-specific conditions. While breeding high yielding and low emitting rice varieties may represent the most promising and possibly sustainable approach for achieving GHG emission reductions without demanding major changes in on-farm management practices, this is rather idealistic. We contend that a more realistic approach for realizing low GHG emitting rice production systems is to focus on increasing rice yields, for obvious food security reasons, which, while not reducing absolute emissions, should translate to a reduction in GHG emission intensities. Moreover, there is need to explore creative ways of incentivizing the adoption of promising combinations of management and technological options.",SUSTAINABILITY,"<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10030671

To critically investigate this, we conducted a global review and meta-analysis of 83 studies of extensive grazing, covering 164 sites across different countries and climatic zones. Unlike previous published reviews we normalized the SOC and total nitrogen (TN) data to a 30 cm depth to be compatible with IPCC guidelines. We also calculated a normalized GI and divided the data into four main groups depending on the regional climate (dry warm, DW; dry cool, DC; moist warm, MW; moist cool, MC). Our results show that taken across all climatic zones and GIs, grazing (below the carrying capacity of the systems) results in a decrease in SOC storage, although its impact on SOC is climate-dependent. When assessed for different regional climates, all GI levels increased SOC stocks under the MW climate (+7.6%) whilst there were reductions under the MC climate (−19%). Under the DW and DC climates, only the low (+5.8%) and low to medium (+16.1%) grazing intensities, respectively, were associated with increased SOC stocks. High GI significantly increased SOC for C4-dominated grassland compared to C3-dominated grassland and C3-C4 mixed grasslands. It was also associated with significant increases in TN and bulk density but had no effect on soil pH.

Concerns over the environmental impact of emissions from manure management have resulted in research efforts focusing on emission abatement. However, questions regarding the successful abatement of manure-related emissions remain. This study uses a meta-analytical approach comprising 89 peer-reviewed studies to quantify emission reduction potentials of abatement options for liquid manure management chains from cattle and pigs. Analyses of emission reductions highlight the importance of accounting for interactions between emissions. Only three out of the eight abatement options considered (frequent removal of manure, anaerobic digesters, and manure acidification) reduced ammonia (3-60%), nitrous oxide (21-55%), and methane (29-74%) emissions simultaneously, whereas in all other cases, tradeoffs were identified. The results demonstrate that a shift from single-stage emission abatement options towards a wholechain perspective is vital in reducing overall emissions along the manure management chain. The study also identifies some key elements like proper clustering, reporting of influencing factors, and explicitly describing assumptions associated with abatement options that can reduce variability in emission reduction estimates. Prioritization of abatement options according to their functioning can help to determine low-risk emission reduction options, specifically options that alter manure characteristics (e.g., reduced protein diets, anaerobic digestion, or slurry acidification). These insights supported by comprehensive emission measurement studies can help improve the effectiveness of emission abatement and harmonize strategies aimed at reducing air pollution and climate change simultaneously. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.","Journal of Environmental Quality","<a href='https://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2017.05.0199
